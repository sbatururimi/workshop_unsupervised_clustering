       "[\"\\nIt’s going to be another tough week for global stocks amid signs that both the U.S. and China are set to escalate their trade war even further, even as President Trump expands the use of his tariff weapon to other countries.\\nBloomberg reported on Friday that China has already formulated a plan to restrict exports of rare earths to the U.S. if it needs to. On another front, President Trump said he plans to impose a 5% U.S. tariff on all Mexican goods because of illegal immigration. Trump on Friday also terminated a preferential treatment to India’s exports of nearly 2,000 products to the U.S. duty-free.\\nThese negative developments are likely to pressure equities further. The S&P 500 just finished its worst May performance in seven years. While investors will focus on these macro issues, below are three stocks which might see price action triggered by company-specific developments.\\n1. Salesforce.com\\nSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which sells software and cloud-based services to corporate clients, will report first-quarter 2019 earnings on Tuesday, June 4, after the market close. On average, analysts expect $0.61 a share profit on sales of $3.56 billion.\\nCRM Weekly TTM\\nSalesforce’s share price chart during the past six months tells a similar story story to that of the overall market which is under pressure due to the U.S.-China trade war and the associated uncertainty that could hurt global technology spending. Trading at $151.41 per share as of Friday's close, the stock has already shed more than half of the gains it posted since the start of the year.\\nBut beyond these macro headwinds, San Francisco-based Salesforce’s business seems to be maturing and with this development the days of large spending on cloud-computing appear to be behind us, at least in the current cycle. In March, the company provided a revenue forecast that fell short of estimates. Sales were forecast to be $3.67-$3.68 billion in the period ending in April. The projected revenue increase of 22% for Q1 would be the smallest year-over-year gain since at least 2010.\\n2. CVS Health\\nAfter boosting its profit outlook at the beginning of May, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) will hold an investor day on Tuesday.\\nCVS Weekly TTM\\nA healthy profit outlook for 2019 and a strong Q1 earnings report, however, have so far failed to boost investor confidence in the stock which is down more than 20% this year. It closed on Friday at $52.37 amid worries over the changing U.S. drug landscape and strong competition from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).\\nCVS management should help “alleviate the uncertainty weighing on shares,” Morgan Stanley) analyst Ricky Goldwasser wrote in a note to clients in April. Concerns persist regarding the integration costs of its $69-billion merger with Aetna (NYSE:AET), which closed in late November, making the merged entity one of the largest health care insurance and benefits companies in the industry.\\nThe merger is a way for CVS to beef up its brick-and-mortar operations while boosting the services side of the business. It's a response to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) efforts at taking on the healthcare industry.\\n3. Beyond Meat\\nThe plant-based meat substitute producer, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) will release Q1 earnings on Thursday, June 6 after the market close. It's the company's first report since going public in early May.\\nBYND 300 Minute Chart\\nThe stock, which closed at $104.12 on Friday, has been the darling of investors since its IPO on Thursday May 2. Though the IPO was priced at $25 a share, it started trading at $46. Beyond Meat's shares have surged more than four-fold on expectations that the company's vegetable-based products have huge market potential.\\nIndeed, the company is targeting consumers who are seeking a meat substitute that looks and tastes good. Beyond Meat’s biggest attraction is that its products come surprisingly close to real meat in taste, smell, texture and appearance.\\nLuckily for Beyond Meat, the $878 million-a-year-and-growing market for meat substitutes was left open by big food players, giving startups like Beyond Meat and privately-held Impossible Foods Inc. an opportunity to fill the gap. To capture the broader market possibilities, Beyond Meat has developed three plant-based products that align with the largest meat categories globally: beef, pork and poultry.\\nOn the back of such a powerful—and unexpected—rally, the stock is highly vulnerable to any slight miss on earnings. For Q1, analysts are expecting a loss of $0.16 a share with sales growing to $31.5 million. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock is flying high again. After a disastrous 2018 in which this social media giant lost more than 40% of its market capitalization, its shares are the second-best performer in the group of the top five U.S. tech firms known as FAANG this year. And while the stock fell almost 2% yesterday, after 4 straight days of gains, it is still 29% up in 2019, climbing from $131.09 on Dec. 31 to $169.13 at Thursday's close.\\nThe stock’s biggest bears are probably scratching their heads and trying to understand what’s behind this powerful rally. On the surface, nothing has changed for Facebook, which operates the world’s largest social communities and messaging services, including Instagram and WhatsApp.\\nFacebook Weekly Chart\\nThe company’s CEO and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is still busy doing damage control after it emerged that his main platform, Facebook, had been manipulated for political gains, letting individuals and groups used it to spread misinformation. The biggest shock came after the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, which raised questions about the company’s privacy practices and exposed weakness in its business model, which relies on monetizing user data.\\nThese issues were so big that they triggered a widespread backlash against Facebook and prompted many investigations into the company. While these probes by the U.S. and European agencies and politicians are still underway, investors’ mood has suddenly turned positive on its shares. Facebook has now recovered much of its lost ground, with analysts’ consensus forecast calling for another 15% surge in the next 12 months. That positivity, in our view, stems from two factors.\\nFirst, despite all the setbacks of the past year, Facebook’s core platform is still growing. At its fourth-quarter presentation on Jan. 30, the company surprised even its most ardent critics by showing a slight increase in the average number of people who use Facebook or its Messenger app daily in both North America and Europe—two markets where the backlash against it was strongest.\\nGlobally, daily active users averaged 1.52 billion in December, rising 9% from a year ago, while monthly active users were 2.32 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\\nSecond, the Facebook platform is still as valuable for advertisers as it was before all the controversies and scandals erupted. In the fourth-quarter, revenue rose more than 30%, while its operating profit margin was a stunning 46%.\\nDominance Over Digital Ad Market\\nThis robust growth shows that the giant social network is still maintaining its dominance over the digital ad marketplace where companies have no option but to go for the duopoly—Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook, the two companies which still collect the most user data and have the capabilities to direct their ads to the right audience.\\nIt would be naive to discount the risks of possible regulations facing social media companies in the coming months and quarters, but it’s also important to recognise that Facebook hasn’t lost its power and still has many options for growth.\\nWhile politicians and regulators are busy figuring out how and when to regulate social networks, Facebook is spending massively to improve its privacy practices and introduce new features which could help make up for the lost revenue from its core feed, and is building up new following through its video-and-photo diaries, a new section which displays TV-like web videos, as well as its hardware for the home.\\nIn a blog post on March 6, Zuckerberg shared his idea of building a privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform. He said:\\n\\n“As I think about the future of the internet, I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today's open platforms.” \\n\\nGoing in this direction, Facebook plans to offer encrypted messaging across all of its major products and allow people to make private conversations ephemeral, according to his post. Around these private communities, it plans to develop value-added products such as electronic payments and e-commerce.\\nBottom Line\\nMaking Facebook acceptable to regulators, politicians, and its users is still very much work-in-progress. Amid this transition, it’s also becoming increasingly clear that advertisers have no other method of reaching their audiences that’s as powerful as Facebook is. That means the worst-case scenario that the market had priced into Facebook stock last year was wrong, and the shares' recent rally is reflecting that reality. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) is leading the pack of top technology stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The most surprising element in FB's rally is that this upward move has survived regulatory probes, fines, and general mistrust about this social media platform.\\nFacebook's shares have surged more than 40% this year, to close on Friday at $185.67. This strong rebound comes after a tumultuous 2018, during which the shares plunged 26%, sapping investor confidence with a variety of high-profile setbacks, including data breaches, user privacy concerns and the political manipulation of its platform.Facebook price chart\\nThough its stock is still trading below 14% from the all-time high that it hit last summer, the powerful move this year defies a doomsday scenario where bears predicted a collapse in sales. For the second-quarter that ended on June 30, Facebook reported a 28% gain in sales, beating analysts’ consensus forecast.\\nGoing forward, there is no guarantee that the challenges will go away for the world’s largest social media platform. In the latest conference call with analysts in July, the company’s chief financial officer warned that Facebook’s slowdown in revenue growth could extend beyond this year, as growing limitations on how much personal data Facebook can collect and use for ads will make it tough to make money through advertising sales.\\nThere is no doubt that the regulatory oversight and antitrust probes will continue to pose a major challenge to social media companies’ future growth as politicians and regulators try to put together a set of rules to control and stem misuse. But when it comes to Facebook, investors are becoming more confident about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s ability to produce market-beating returns and downplaying the company’s conservative tone.\\nHere are the two main reasons behind this optimism:\\n1. User Growth\\nOne of the key metrics that is life and death for any social media company is its user- engagement. Over the past several quarters, there has been a clear trend emerging when it comes to Facebook’s main app. The growth in the platforms main revenue-generation regions — North America and Europe — is stagnating.\\nThe number of daily users of the Facebook social network and the company’s Messenger app rose to 1.6 billion people in the second quarter, with a growth rate of 8% from a year ago — the second-slowest in the company’s history.\\nWhile growth at the main Facebook app has slowed, the company is still adding users quickly on other properties. A total of 2.7 billion people use at least one Facebook-owned app — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or FB Messenger — every month, making its the world’s largest social network.\\n2. New Growth Drivers\\nWhat’s keeping investors excited about Facebook’s prospects is its ability to continue attracting ad dollars with its 2.7 billion users on different platforms. A key growth area is the company’s Stories features, which are full-screen photos and videos users can post on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\\nFacebook’s move into e-commerce via its Instagram and What’sApp apps could add billions of dollars to its revenue within a few years. The Instagram photo-sharing app, which has ads in its photo feed and recently added e-commerce tools, is becoming a more significant part of the business.\\nTo deal with a possible slowdown in its advertising business, Facebook is pushing into new areas, including payments and e-commerce. Zuckerberg said that now that Facebook users are linked to large networks of people and organizations, his next step is to help them derive value from those connections.\\nIn June, Facebook said it is expanding its video-on-demand service, Watch, and has teamed up with global publishers to bring their content to the Watch platform. Deutsche Bank  analysts believe that Watch could contribute $5 billion in revenues by 2021.\\nThese growth initiatives are in addition to the company’s controversial cryptocurrency project, Libra, which is facing global resistance since it was announced in June. According to Facebook, the main purpose of Libra is to enable people to use and transfer money around the globe more cheaply than current options allow, and that adding Libra would be most useful in countries where banking options are scant and the home currency is volatile.\\nBottom Line\\nAfter a powerful rally this year, Facebook shares are weathering the increased volatility in markets much better than other tech stocks. FB’s continued ability to drive engagement and monetization of its existing properties make its stock a solid long-term bet, despite the recent setbacks on the regulatory front. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAfter a dreadful winter and a gloomy spring, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors are finally seeing some signs of a brighter summer.\\nThe electric car maker last week announced a record number of deliveries, saying it shipped 95,200 cars in the second quarter, beating the previous company record of 90,700 set in the fourth quarter of 2018. Analysts were expecting about 91,000 deliveries for the period.\\nThe headline certainly blew some fresh wind into the company's sails. Purchases of Tesla’s cheaper Model 3 sedan had dropped sharply in the first quarter, even after several rounds of price cuts.\\nHurt by a series of missteps in the past year, Tesla shares had lost almost half of their value in the six months to late May. But, although they slipped in the last two sessions, the shares have gained 12.6% since the beginning of June and were trading at $230.34 at yesterday's close.\\nTesla price chart\\nHowever, despite this new momentum, the troubles that Tesla is facing are far from over, in our view.\\nOne major reason we remain concerned is that Tesla's path to profitability is still fraught with danger. Though the company was able to deliver more cars in the second-quarter due to strong demand from European markets and Canada, its higher-margin Model S and Model X are still struggling.\\nCombined deliveries of these models fell to 17,650 in the quarter, down more than 20% from a year ago and 50% from the previous quarter. Many analysts are concerned the cheaper Model 3 is cannibalizing the automaker’s more expensive cars, making it tougher for the company to make money in the long-run.\\nAmbitious Target\\nEven with the quarterly surge in demand, it’s still not clear whether Tesla will be able to meet its ambitious 2019 target of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Tesla’s press release was quiet on this front. With the U.S. federal tax credit for electric vehicles shrinking for the second half of the year and ending in 2020, it will become even harder for the company to sell more cars in the U.S. in the second-half.\\nAnd Tesla may have to rely again on overseas markets to fill the gap, while at the same time keeping its shipping and logistics costs under control. Due to these lingering concerns, many Wall Street analysts aren’t yet ready to change their negative view on Tesla, notwithstanding the positive surprise of the past week.\\n“We continue to expect some sequential step-down in demand and ultimately deliveries as we progress into 3Q19,” Goldman Sachs’ analyst David Tamberrino, wrote in a note. Tamberrino has a “sell” rating on the stock with a price target of $158.\\nBarclays’ analyst Brian Johnson, who rates the stock “underweight” with a price target of $150, expressed similar views in a recent note:\\n\\n“Tesla’s incentives are fiercely bent on maximizing deliveries to focus on cash generation, likely at the expense of profitability. We continue to expect a loss this quarter as well as a challenging sales/profit environment for the remainder of the year.”\\n\\nBottom Line\\nTesla’s stock continues to remain a highly speculative bet. Its premium valuation compared to industry peers is hard to justify when the overall demand picture remains muddy and the company continues to face deep cash-flow issues. It would be better for investors to ignore the noise created by the upbeat delivery numbers, and instead, focus on the company’s upcoming Q2 earnings release to get more clarity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAs the volatility in the markets increases and investors re-price their risks, one proven strategy to survive in this environment is to focus on companies which have time-tested products and services. Stock prices of these old-economy companies are sure to bounce back once the dust has settled and normal trading patterns resume.\\nIf you’re a long-term income investor with plenty of dry powder on the sideline and were looking for better entry points, this market pullback is a great news. Lower stock prices of some top-quality dividend stocks mean their yields have become more attractive. Keeping this theme in mind, I'm recommending Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). In this ongoing volatile trading, investors have seen J&J's share value decline despite the fact that its business is growing and it’s not facing any major threats to its future profitability.\\nJNJ Weekly 2015-2018\\nHere's why this pharma behemoth might be a good pick for your portfolio.\\nMarket-Beating Returns \\nJohnson & Johnson doesn’t get too much financial press because it’s an old, boring stock that rarely surprises investors. But if you analyze how much investors have benefited from having this stock in their portfolios you might be surprised. During the past two decades, this New Brunswick, New Jersey-based healthcare giant delivered a total return of more than 489% to shareholders. To keep things in perspective, the benchmark S&P 500 Index returned just under 288% over the same period.\\nThe biggest advantage of having buy-and-hold stocks in your portfolio is that you don’t need to worry about market ups and downs on a daily basis. You don’t invest in J&J to make a quick buck. All you care about is a consistent income stream that's beating the inflation beast and growing every year.\\nThe dividend is your friend in both good and bad times, as long as the company is able to make their dividend payments during downturns as well as upturns. Increasing payouts make it easier for you to hold on to your investment even when the share price contracts. Investors who made about 500% in total returns while holding on to J&J stock have successfully ridden through many market crashes and bubbles, including the Great Recession of 2008 and the dot-com bubble of 2001.\\nWhen it comes to rewarding investors, few companies have done better than Johnson & Johnson. The company has increased its quarterly dividend rate every year for 56 consecutive years. This remarkable performance puts Johnson & Johnson among an elite group known as “dividend kings,” companies with at least five decades of annual dividend hikes. And though its payout ratio of 57.04% could be considered a tad high by some, given the company's strength and stellar dividend history, it should be considered a healthy metric in this case.\\nGrowth momentum \\nThe latest numbers suggest that J&J’s earning momentum is still going strong, and there is no reason for long-term investors to panic. Last month, the company reported that its fourth-quarter sales surged 11.5%, while its net income jumped 9.5% as the company beat analysts expectations.\\nThis strength came from the fact that J&J has one of the biggest R&D budgets in the industry. Since 2015 it has spent more than other large pharma firms on M&A. And the company has done almost twice as many drug-licensing deals as its nearest large pharma competitor over that same period, according to Bloomberg data.\\nFor dividend investors, the current stock price—it closed at $129.67 yesterday—might be a good entry point, following the 7% dip this year. Trading with the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of just 15, J&J stock is much cheaper now than it was a month ago.\\nThe timing to make the entry seems perfect, especially when management plans to repatriate $12 billion in overseas cash. Analysts are expecting that most of this money will go toward higher dividends or share buybacks.\\nOver the last five years, J&J has increased the dividend between 5% and 8.1%. Given the new tax code and all that cash, I wouldn't be surprised if the company hits the top of the range when it’s likely to announce its new dividend plan in April.\\nThe bottom line: If your investment objective is to buy solid dividend stocks in order to earn a steady income, you can’t go wrong with J&J. It's one of the biggest dividend distributors in the pharma industry. With a strong balance sheet, cash flows and a dominant market position in consumer healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, you can rely on Johnson & Johnson’s dividend for years to come. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nWith U.S.-China trade tensions continuing to consume much of the market\\'s attention, it’s tough to stay focused on earnings results and other economic indicators that, so far, have remained mostly positive for equities. Indeed, those were the primary drivers for the stock rebound on Friday, along with some positive signals from both President Donald Trump and China on a solution to a trade deal, even after the U.S. acted on its threat and raised tariffs on some Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.\\nIn broader trading, U.S. equities rebounded after initially selling off when tariffs on Chinese imports were hiked.

(NASDAQ:TLRY), will report first quarter earnings on Tuesday, May 14, after the market close. Analysts, on average, expect a loss of $0.27 a share on sales of $20.16 million as the cannabis producer strives to capture market share after Canada, last October, became the first developed country to allow recreational consumption.\\nThe company expects 2019 revenue to at least triple from last year’s $43 million, helped by the company’s recent acquisition of Manitoba Harvest as well as the company’s ability to meet growing U.S. demand for hemp-derived CBD, the non-intoxicating cousin of THC.\\nTLRY Weekly TTM\\nBut investors haven’t been convinced about the company’s stock valuation in recent months. Shares skyrocketed 400% in late 2018 after its July IPO last year—at one point briefly hitting $300 per share. However, Tilray now trades just below $50 as of Friday\\'s close.\\nWe see Tilray as one of the long-run winners in the still nascent marijuana industry, but we don’t see negative earnings disappearing any time soon. The company continues to invest heavily to increase production and carve out broader market share.\\n2. Nvidia\\nOne of the U.S.\\'s largest chip-makers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports first-quarter 2019 earnings on Thursday, May 16, after the market close. Analysts are expecting $0.79 a share profit, down from $2.05 a year ago. Sales are likely to fall 31% to $2.02 billion, according to consensus forecasts.\\nNVDA Weekly 2016-2019\\nAfter a massive sell-off of once high-flying semiconductor stocks in the last quarter of 2018, investors are eagerly watching to see some solid signs of a rebound in demand from the company’s key markets—gaming and data centers. Shares of the California-based company closed on Friday at $168.82, about 30% higher than the December low.\\nStill the stock remains nearly 40% below its record high of $292.76, hit in late September, after demand plunged from the peak of last year and the company cut its growth forecast. In the current environment, we don’t see Nvidia stock reaching last year’s peak anytime soon as uncertainties over China trade continue to linger.\\n\"Semiconductor suppliers have relatively high ‘ship-to’ revenue exposure to China,” Quinn Bolton, senior semiconductor analyst at Needham, said in a note last week. “This high exposure to China puts the semiconductor sector at greater risk to the escalation in the U.S.-China trade war than many other segments of technology.”\\n3. Pinterest\\nSan Francisco-based, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) will be releasing its first quarterly report on Thursday, after it began trading publicly on April 18. Analysts consensus calls for a $0.15 loss per share on sales of $200.4 million.\\nIn its IPO filing, the tech company that provides a digital platform for inspiration boards said it made about $756 million in revenue from online advertisements in 2018, a 60% growth rate from the previous year. Its net loss fell to $63 million in 2018 from $130 million in 2017. Pinterest says 265 million people use the digital scrapbook at least once a month.\\nPINS 300 Minute Chart\\nFrom its post-IPO peak of $35.29, Pinterest shares have fallen more than 15%, closing at $29.05 a share on Friday. Some analysts have been raising concerns about its growth potential in a crowded digital marketing space. The company is competing with social media giants such as Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and its Instagram app, as well as Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube. Both have already captured the majority of ad spending in this segment.\\nBut Pinterest—which serves as a sort of digital bulletin board for pictures and ideas for furniture, fashion, weddings, recipes and more—says it offers a different and more targeted platform than these social media giants. Its shares may resume their upward momentum if the company is able to show both user and revenue growth in this past quarter. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nBroadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) recent bleak demand forecast provided investors in chip stocks yet another ominous sign. Its broad product line and global customer base make the chipmaker's earnings an important indicator of things to come. Unfortunately, the news isn't good.\\nThe San Jose, California-based company, after market close on Thursday, not only cut its annual forecast, but also warned that the U.S.-China trade dispute is causing a “sharp and rapid contraction,” in demand from customers, including the largest smartphone makers, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies.\\nBroadcom is also one of the leading suppliers of networking components used by large data center operators such as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud division. Following the U.S. ban on exports to Huawei, Broadcom is likely to suffer a $2-billion hit on its annual sales, a much higher number than anticipated.\\n“It is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict, including the Huawei export ban, is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a conference call, according to Bloomberg. “Our customers are actively reducing inventory levels.”\\nBroadcom, which said the reduced revenue forecast is still “very conservative,” is among the first chip makers to quantify the impact of the escalating U.S.-China trade war. There's no doubt that this offers a grim outlook for other semiconductor stocks as well.\\nBroad-based Demand Weakness\\nBroadcom shares plunged as much as 9% in Friday trading, before recovering some ground to close down 5.6% at $265.93. The stock is up just about 5% this year, vs the 18% gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the industry benchmark.\\nBroadcom weekly chart\\nThe company’s latest earnings, plus the weak performance from other top chip companies, confirm our earlier bearish call on the industry. Semiconductor companies have a major portion of their growth tied to China, where spending on gaming and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for their products. A slowing global economy, especially a more pronounced slowdown in China, will continue to keep demand under pressure this year.\\nThe latest guidance from Broadcom also shows that the U.S.-China trade spat is not the only reason demand is slowing and that the weakness is probably more broad-based. According to the chipmaker, equipment manufacturers to which it supplies parts were slowing purchases even before the Huawei ban and the $2-billion revenue shortfall reflects the possibility of a more pronounced contraction.\\nBottom Line\\nWith almost all major earnings reports out from the big chip producers, it’s very clear that this is not the right time to buy chip stocks. This year’s rally in these stocks was based on very weak ground and we see these gains evaporating quickly as other top players follow Broadcom and cut their revenue forecasts. A scenario where demand could revive quickly for chip producers is too optimistic, in our view. Investors would be wise to stay on the sidelines. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n* Reports Q4 2018 earnings Tuesday, Feb. 26 before the bell* Consensus EPS: $2.53* Revenue Expectation: $8.44B\\nInvestors are finding it hard to bet on the turnaround of Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) in 2019, especially after the retail giant shocked the markets by cutting its full-year earnings expectations last month, citing weakening sales in categories such as women’s sportswear, fashion jewelry and cosmetics. According to the company’s revised forecast, comparable sales will grow about 2%, down from a previous outlook of at least 2.3%, while earnings are now seen at $3.95 - $4 a share, down from the previous forecast of $4.10 - $4.30.\\nThis unexpected setback caused investors to flee, deserting Macy's already vulnerable shares, and erasing almost all of their 2018 gains. The shares closed down 1.6% Friday, at $24.06. The stock has fallen more than 10% in the past year.\\nMacy's Weekly Chart\\nWhat lies ahead for the top brick-and-mortar retailer is very much dependent on its future guidance and how quickly it is able to win investor confidence. In our view, that goal is becoming increasingly difficult for the retail chain to achieve.\\nWe've become pessimistic about the sustainability of Macy’s turnaround and the retail environment in general; many of the tailwinds that were supporting retailers last year are weakening in 2019 and we see the risks to the downside growing. Tax cuts in 2018, for example, helped consumers to spend more, which in turn helped these retailers to boost their sales. We don’t expect that wealth effect to be there in 2019.\\nOn the macro front, the economy is entering uncharted territory where wage inflation, global trade risks and political uncertainty are coming together to weaken consumer sentiment.\\nIs Macy’s Stock Worth Betting On?\\nOnce these macro risks are factored in, it’s hard to make a case for taking the risk on Macy’s stock, especially when its shares remain so volatile after briefly recovering from their long slump. That said, we don’t want to downplay the company’s serious efforts to revive sales and get it ready to compete with online competition.\\nMacy’s has been spending to lift its digital presence, adding more local merchandise and refreshing in-store fixtures. That strategy has helped boost online sales and proven to be a great success at building in-store traffic.\\nThe retailer expects to exceed $1 billion in online sales this year. Macy's customers are finding its online platform — which lets customers check prices on its app, track order histories, do visual product searches and also chat with customer representatives — very useful.\\nDespite the recent sharp sell-off, we still view Macy’s as a good turnaround bet for investors who have the stomach to wait for the company’s turnaround efforts to produce results.\\nThe company is on the right track and making many bold decisions, including remodeling its stores, reducing its real-estate, expanding its popular Backstage off-price concept, and growing its Bluemercury cosmetics chain.\\nBottom Line\\nDown almost 43% from its 52-week high, we don’t see too much further downside from here for this stock. But investors should wait and see what Macy’s management are forecasting for 2019 before taking action. The mega retailer's future outlook will determine whether its stock has reached a bottom in the current bearish cycle. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n- Reports Q4 2019 results on Thursday, Feb. 14 after the market close\\n- Revenue expectation: $2.3 billion\\n- EPS expectation: $0.71\\nGlobal chipmakers have done one thing right in this cycle where demand for their products is sliding fast: they have been able to manage expectations quite well.\\nWhen Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports fiscal fourth-quarter 2019 earnings on Thursday, investors have already priced in the worst following the company’s advance downward revision in Q4 guidance late last month.\\nNvidia cut its outlook for Q4 revenue, citing weaker sales of \"gaming and data center platforms.\" The industry\\'s biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards blamed a slowing global economy, especially in China, for its lagging growth.\\nIt said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of about $2.2 billion, down from a previous forecast of about $2.7 billion.\\nNvidia (NVDA) - 1-Month Chart\\nEarnings per share is likely to be just more than half of what the company made in the same period a year ago, following a $120-million charge that Nvidia said it will book associated with the updated revenue guidance and current market conditions.\\nBut the biggest disappointment for us was the company’s revelation that demand for its data center products is also facing a slowdown. That segment of the market was expected to help large chipmakers, like Nvidia, when their sales to cryptocurrency companies were almost wiped out after the collapse of that market.\\nUnder Pressure Until At Least July\\nThis broad-based weakness suggests that it will take much longer than expected for chip producers to get back to their growth trajectory, especially when growth in China continues to slow and buyers wait for a further decline in prices for graphic cards. Nvidia generates roughly 18 percent of its revenue from China.\\nThese multiple challenges are likely to keep Nvidia shares under pressure, at least for the first half of this year. After losing more than half of their value since the October high, Nvidia shares have risen just 3 percent in the past month compared with gains of about 13 percent in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index.\\nThe downfall of this once-high-flying stock is also a reminder to investors that managing inventory in the graphics card market is one of the biggest risks to their earnings once demand dries up and customers stop purchasing.\\nNvidia needs to clear inventory from both its crypto and PC-gaming cards segments that built up in the current down cycle. The reduction in that inventory has proceeded largely in line with expectations, Nvidia said in the January update. But analysts expect the company’s videogaming segment revenues to show year-over-year declines for the next three quarters.\\nAt its peak in October, Nvidia was worth about $176 billion, nearly 5x its value from just two years earlier. The company is worth about $92 billion now.\\nBottom Line\\nNvidia’s heavy exposure to crypto and gaming markets will continue to have a drag on its share price and we don’t see a quick recovery to this down cycle anytime soon. With this bleak picture, investors should watch for any signs of demand recovery when Nvidia reports Q4 earnings and gives an update for 2019. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of popular iPhones, is certainly keeping its bulls happy. The stock is showing strong resilience, surprising many analysts who thought the company’s maturing phone business would weigh down hard on its share price.\\nBut that pessimistic case against Apple is weakening fast after the company’s launch of the iPhone 11, which, unlike several previous models, is getting an enthusiatic reception. Indeed, last week, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported that Apple has instructed its suppliers to ramp up iPhone 11 production by 10%.\\nThis news is coupled with several analysts raising their own projections, citing similar feedback from the company’s supply chain. Wall Street’s consensus estimates for iPhone shipments in Apple’s current fiscal year have increased by 3 million units since the new models went on sale on Sept. 20, according to FactSet.\\n“We are modestly raising our iPhone volume forecasts and expect investor sentiment on AAPL shares to improve materially,” J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a recent note, raising its price target on Apple stock to $265 a share from $243 a share. “We are also increasing calendar 2020/2021 volume expectations led by stronger adoption of 5G enabled iPhones expected to be launched in September 2020,” Chatterjee added.\\nApple price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFueled by these positive catalysts, Apple shares hit a record high of $229.93 on Oct. 7. Trading at $227.03 at yesterday's close, the stock has rebounded about 60% from its December low. But the big question going forward is whether this bullish trend is sustainable and is this the right time to bet long on Apple?\\nDisruption in Supply Chain\\nThe risks to the maker of iPhones are many and serious in nature. The biggest among them is the disruption in the company’s massive supply-chain system — a comprehensive network of low-cost suppliers — if the U.S.-China trade dispute intensifies. Officials from China are meeting with their U.S. counterparts this week to try to iron out their differences. And there are media reports saying that China is willing to agree on a limited trade deal if U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to show some flexibility on tariffs.\\nBesides the iPhone 11-related optimism, investors are becoming increasingly confident that China won’t hurt Apple if the current trade spat continues because of the company's massive contribution to the Chinese economy. In a note to clients this summer, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan gave a low probability to a scenario where Apple gets caught up in the U.S.-China crossfire.\\nWith the China risks being re-evaluated, investors are again focusing on the company’s strong product pipeline and its push to accelerate sales through its services division.\\nOne new driver which will increase the demand for new hardware is the roll-out of the fifth-generation, or 5G phones in 2020. Wall Street’s estimates for the impact of 5G iPhones on Apple are too conservative, according to Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy.\\n“We think the Street underestimates the benefit AAPL gets from this heading into the 5G cycle,” McNealy said in a note to clients last week. Wall Street is estimating that Apple will sell 190 million 5G devices in 2021, which is 9% below the six-year average unit volume for the iPhone. McNealy said these estimates are too conservative. He estimates 208 million iPhones will be shipped in 2021.\\nThe latest bullish trend in the stock is also reflecting CEO Tim Cook’s success in diversifying Apple’s revenue away from iPhones. The company’s services, which include Apple Music, movie rentals and app downloads, produced 33% growth last year with sales touching $40 billion—accounting for about 15% of the company’s total of $265.6 billion.\\nSo far this year, that trend continues. Apple's revenue from iPhones fell by $19 billion in the nine months ended in June. The sales of everything else increased by a combined $12.6 billion, showing how quickly the Services division is picking up the slack.\\nThat contribution will continue to grow once the company’s new line of services—- video-streaming, Apple Pay and gaming — start to chip in. According to an estimate by Morgan Stanley, the services contribution will continue to grow and could generate about 60% of Apple’s revenue in the next five years.\\nBottom Line\\nApple’s current move higher is backed by real improvements in fundamentals and some re-pricing of the risk that analysts had associated with the U.S.-China trade war. We continue to recommend Apple shares for long-term investors who want to have a solid tech name in their portfolio. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThis isn't how equity investors expected 2018 to wind down. Over the course of the year, corporate profits have been strong, the economy was booming, and US President Donald Trump’s tax cuts were supposed to trickle down, helping both consumers and companies spend more.\\nBut as we enter the final week of 2018, the picture has turned decidedly ugly. During the past three months, fear and uncertainty have gripped investors, triggering a massive sell-off that's wiped out about $5 trillion of global equity values and 'gifted' investors with a bruising day of trade on Christmas Eve, the market's worst performance for that day in its history.\\nWhat’s different in this downturn is that buying the dip, a strategy investors employed to rescue this unprecedented bull run several times over the past decade, appears to no longer be in play. Some of the strongest growth stocks during the bull, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are likely to finish the year in the red.\\nThe headwinds for social media giants Facebook, Google and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), were especially powerful. Those companies were hurt by investor fears of government scrutiny and regulation after their platforms were used by US adversaries, such as Russia, to manipulate public opinion and allegedly the 2016 election. As well, reports of massive data breaches also raised public concerns about the longer term viability of these companies.\\nApple, the iPhone and Mac producer that became the world’s most valuable company for a period during the summer and into the fall, remained immune to the problems social media companies faced. But during the last quarter, it succumbed to pressures created by the worsening macro environment as investors fretted that the iPhone growth supercycle is over, leaving future sales weaker if global growth slows and the US-China trade war escalates.\\nIn the technology space, chipmakers who once benefited from the consumer frenzy for smartphones, video games, and a surge in demand from artificial intelligence firms and cryptocurrency miners saw their share values decimated on the first sign that peak demand is a thing of the past.\\nChipmakers The Biggest Losers\\nNVDA Weekly 2016-2018\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the largest chip producers and for years a Wall Street darling had, arguably, one of the most dramatic reversals. It saw its market cap surge from just $14 billion in 2016 to over $175 billion by September of 2018. Its share price has since been pummeled—currently down 54%—making it the worst performer in the S&P 500 over that stretch.\\nThe nation’s largest energy stocks gave up most of their gains as well, after the rally that sent global benchmark Brent crude to above $86 a barrel in October quickly fizzled. Signs there was a glut of oil in the market, at a time when global growth is slowing, weighed on the commodity.\\nCVX Weekly 2016-2018\\nFears of recession also helped turn investor sentiment against some still-strong energy stocks which continue to produce excellent cash flows after years of belt-tightening and enhanced production efficiencies. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the two largest integrated energy producers, are ending the year with losses close to 25%.\\nIn this market rout, however, not everyone was a loser. As volatility spiked and the macro environment worsened, investors turned to stocks which usually provide safety and income. Utilities, healthcare, and non-discretionary consumer stocks weathered this storm much better than many growth stocks.\\nBoth Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the multinational consumer staple manufacturer, and Merck (NYSE:NYSE:MRK), a global healthcare provider, are each up more than 15% over the past six months while the S&P 500 is down about 20% over the same period.\\nTo date, the nation’s top bricks-and-mortar retailers, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and the e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also failed to sustain their rallies despite strong consumer spending that helped their growth repeatedly beat analyst estimates.\\nAMZN Weekly 2016-2018\\nAmazon shares, which at one point were up 70% on the year, have now fallen 34% from that level. The stock could easily finish 2018r with just low double-digit gains.\\nBottom Line\\nIt’s hard to place the blame for the current poor performance of equities in 2018 on just one thing. Perhaps the biggest catalyst that prompted many investors to move to the sidelines, pushing markets into bear territory, was the worsening macro environment.\\nThat included—and continues to include—the US-China trade war that threatens to put the brakes on global growth; the more hawkish Fed which says it will remain steadfast in its rate-tightening policy; and President Trump, who through his aggressive moves, often communicated via tweet, has kept investors jittery and uncertain about what's next. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is probably one of the most complex stocks on the Street to analyze. On the one hand, it\\'s a company that\\'s building products which have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry. However, on the other hand, there\\'s founder and CEO Elon Musk whose unpredictable behavior and blunders—often fueled by odd or poorly thought out tweets—have the potential to destroy the enterprise he so famously built.\\nJust days after he abandoned a half-backed plan to take Tesla private, this past Tuesday, Musk was back on Twitter, denying that he cried during a New York Times interview earlier this month and trading barbs with a follower who criticized him for calling a cave explorer in Thailand a pedophile back in July. His latest Twitter appearance comes following a two-week drama that played out after he disclosed on August 7 that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share, without telling stakeholders the funding source for this massive undertaking.\\nTSLA Weekly 2015-2018\\nThe news triggered a short-lived rally in Tesla, pushing shares 13% higher. But the stock plunged after the company released a statement confirming Musk’s tweet to go private, but with no mention of financing.\\nTesla\\'s abrupt rise and fall has reportedly prompted a subpoena from the regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission, which, according to some reports, is looking into the possibility of stock manipulation. As for analysis of Musk\\'s behavior is probably a job for a psychologist. Still, if you own shares of Tesla just because Musk’s vision and leadership were inspiring, this is probably the right time to revisit the risk-reward equation. At this point, in our view, the risks far exceed the rewards.\\nCash Crunch Back In Focus\\nWall Street is broadly divided on Tesla. Of 27 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 have hold ratings on the stock, nine recommend buying and eight recommend selling.\\nTesla is the most short-sold stock in the United States, with investors betting around $10.18 billion that the company’s shares will fall, according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners. Of course, Tesla has proved short-sellers wrong many times in the past.\\nNonetheless, despite all the drama and mystery surrounding Musk, it’s a fact that Tesla has revolutionized the auto industry and paved the way for early adoption of electric cars. However, the company hasn’t yet shown a profit. Yet its share price has jumped 1,581% since going public in 2010, which makes Tesla\\'s valuation higher than Ford\\'s (NYSE:F) or General Motors\\' (NYSE:GM). But Tesla\\'s goal of rapidly building affordable cars for mass markets has proven difficult for the company to achieve.\\nAfter the past two weeks’ of upheaval which has put Elon Musk’s credibility and future at stake, investor focus is back to Tesla’s cash crunch which likely prompted Musk\\'s failed private buyout effort. According to a Reuters report, Tesla may need to borrow up to $2 billion by the end of the year to stay afloat. Analysts are also forecasting a continued cash burn in the second half of 2018.\\nDuring the conference call at the time of the company\\'s Q2 earnings report on August 1, Musk reiterated that Tesla will turn profitable and cash-flow positive in the current quarter as production of the Model 3 almost doubles versus the prior one. But given Tesla’s poor track record on guidance and Musk’s recent odd behavior, it’s likely that Tesla will again need to go back to the market to raise cash.\\nCurrently Tesla has $1.3 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months, while it has just $1.3 billion of cash in the bank after backing out $942 million of customer deposits on cars. For debt investors, this won’t be an appropriate time to commit funds to a company whose CEO is under severe pressure and faces the possibility of various allegations including stock manipulation.\\nBottom Line\\nThe extreme volatility of Tesla shares, which closed last night at $305.01 is a clear signal that the market is having trouble making sense of where Tesla is headed. In a recent note, JPMorgan & Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman said, if he had to value Tesla on \"fundamentals alone,\" the stock may fall to $195 by December if there is no buyout. The investment bank had set its previous, $308 price target on August 8, based on Musk\\'s optimism about a go-private deal.\\nThis type of bearish sentiment suggests that a segment of the market has already started to price Tesla without Musk at the helm. We believe this overhang will continue to weigh on the stock going forward unless there is a fundamental shift in Musk\\'s behavior. We\\'re not convinced that will happen. For serious investors, it’s better to stay on the sidelines and watch the drama unfold. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Its shares are up about 25 percent so far in 2019, more than 5x the levels the benchmark S&P 500 is up.\\nTeva is trying to recover from a three-year slump that sent its shares tumbling as the company invested heavily to grow its copycat medicines business.\\nTeva Pharma (TEVA) 3-year Chart\\nThat happened at a time when margins began to shrink in the U.S. amid fierce competition from other producers. The biggest setback came when Teva lost its monopoly on Copaxone, a blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection that generated half of the company’s profits at one point.\\nThe challenges for the Israel-based generic drug giant are enormous. It has to reduce its massive debt load at a time when generic drug prices are falling in the key U.S. market and new competition for its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug is intensifying.\\nBut we believe Teva’s restructuring program is getting into shape and 2019 will be the year when investors will see it begin to pay off.\\nIn the third quarter CEO Kare Schultz, who has occupied the top slot for more than year now, showed that he is making a solid progress on reducing the company’s leverage and cutting costs. Net borrowings, which peaked in 2016 at around $35 billion, have fallen below $30 billion.\\nSales of MS drug Copaxone fell after new competitors emerged, but new product launches like migraine treatment Ajovy will bring in new revenue stream in the next two to three years.\\nAjovy won U.S. regulatory approval in September. More than 36 million people suffer from these debilitating episodes and the medicine could generate around $500 million of sales by 2022, according to analysts’ estimates.\\nDespite these positive signs, a complete turnaround won’t show in the numbers yet. Teva is forecast to report sales down more than 17 percent in the most recent quarter, with earnings per share shrinking to $0.54 from $0.93 in the year-ago period.\\nBottom Line\\nTeva is a good turnaround situation for value investors.\\nDespite its powerful rally in 2019, the stock is still quite cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 6.9. If the company’s deleveraging and cost cutting continues and new experimental drugs, such as a non-opioid pain treatment, prove successful, we could see Teva’s sales growth revive sooner rather than later.\\nTeva isn’t fully out of the woods, but for contrarian investors the time to take a chance is now, when the stock is cheap. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nIn this low interest-rate environment, it’s difficult to find avenues where you can get higher yields. The best CD rates in October were around 2.25% for a one-year term, while the 10-year Treasury was offering 1.57%.\\nWith those low rates, it’s natural for income-seeking investors to look somewhere else to earn higher returns and one area to look is the energy sector. When it comes to dividend yields, oil stocks generally beat the market. To explain why they offer generous yields — in some cases as high as 7% — investors should understand that they’re getting paid for the exposure they’re taking to highly volatile oil prices.\\n\\nThe recent example of this boom-and-bust cycle in energy markets was the deep slump in oil prices that started in 2014, after a remarkable run of the preceding decade in which crude oil prices traded even more than $100 a barrel.\\nBut the 2014 downturn was so sharp and painful that it caused several oil producers to reduce or eliminate their dividend as prices plunged. Keeping these risks in mind, investors can still pick some bargains from the energy sector. Here are two candidates to consider for the yield-hungry investors:\\n1. Royal Dutch Shell \\nAmong the oil supermajors, it’s hard to ignore Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) when it comes to earning a hefty dividend. The company pays $0.94 a share quarterly dividend which translates into a 6.65% dividend yield on yesterday’s price.The shares closed up about 1% at $57.26 yesterday. They're down about 2% so far this year, after a 45% jump since hitting the 2016 low. In the company’s latest strategy update in June, the Anglo-Dutch oil major is forecasting a much stronger cash generation over the coming years. That could mean the producer will be in a better position to hike its dividend, which it kept flat during the past four years.Shell price chartShell says it has the potential to spend $125 billion on dividends and share repurchases between 2021 and 2025. The company paid $16 billion in annual dividend last year on top of the current buyback program that is averaging out just under $10 billion annually.That forecast could prove optimistic, however, if the current downturn in oil prices persists. Shell stock underperformed after the 2014 oil slump as the company’s debt ballooned after its massive acquisition of BG Group. Since then, Shell has worked aggressively to cut its debt and has made returning cash to investors its priority.In our view, Shell is much better-prepared this time to cope with a prolonged slide in oil prices thanks to the company’s aggressive debt reduction strategy, backed by its plans to sell assets worth $30 billion.\\n\\n2. BP The London-based  BP PLC  (NYSE:BP) is another strong name when it comes to paying dividends. Its current yield is 6.62%, translating into quarterly payout of $0.615 a share. That payout has risen just 5% since 2014, showing the cash constraints this oil giant has faced since then. The shares are down 2% since the start of the year and closed at $37.16 yesterday. \\nBP price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the main reasons BP remains cash-starved is the 2010’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The company is still paying for that disaster and will continue to do so for a few more years.\\n\\nDuring the second-quarter earnings season, BP beat expectations and increased its cash flow as higher production offset the effect of lower energy prices.\\n\\nCash flow from operations excluding payments related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill rose 17% from a year earlier to $8.2 billion. On top of the payment for buying the U.S. fields, BP also paid about $1.4 billion in penalties associated with the 2010 catastrophe. BP will sell $4 billion to $5 billion of assets this year, part of a plan to complete $10 billion in divestments by 2020 and use the proceeds to reduce its debt ratios.\\nBottom Line\\n\\nFor long-term income investors, both companies offer a different appeal. If you're an oil bull, Shell’s juicy dividend yield is worth considering, especially as the company’s effort to repair its balance sheet is producing results. If oil prices improve from here, Shell has an attractive asset mix to produce robust cash flows with the potential for growing dividends.\\n\\nBP, on the other hand, is pursuing many growth projects that position it to generate hefty free cash flow by 2021. In addition, the company has a new CEO Bernard Looney who might bring new ideas to reward investors once the company’s asset restructuring is over and the oil-spill related penalties are paid. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThere's a simple rule for those seeking income from dividend stocks—make sure you diversify. When inflationary pressures are building up, like now, and bond yields are rising, some top-quality dividend stocks are coming under pressure. Higher rates hurt non-cyclical stocks such as power and gas utilities and telecom operators.\\nBut when the economy is going strong and consumers have more money to spend on discretionary items, that’s when industrial and consumer stocks outperform. In this group we particularly like Nike (NYSE:NKE).\\nUS Sales, And The Stock, Are Coming Back\\nNike’s powerful comeback this year is a reminder to bears that the Oregon-based sportswear giant hasn’t lost its allure for income investors. And it’s doing many things right in order to revive lackluster sales in its home market.\\nNike 1-Year Chart\\nTrading near its record high, the stock closed yesterday at $83, Nike shares are up more than 45% in the past year, proving it's one of the best dividend stocks to own in this bull run. The biggest sign that the company is on the right track to deliver superior returns is the revival of sales growth in North America.\\nAfter three quarters during which US sales contracted, the company reversed that trend in the second quarter as consumers, encouraged by a strong economy, tax cuts and rising wages, flocked back to malls.\\nThis reversal in the domestic market comes at a time when Nike remains a powerful brand overseas, from where the company generates more than half its revenue. China sales rose 35% in the quarter ended May 31, while revenue from Asia Pacific and Latin America gained 12%. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 24%.\\nNike’s strong global brand provides a solid hedge against any slowdown in US sales. But so far, the company doesn’t see any sign that consumers will put the brakes on their spending. Nike is now forecasting annual sales growth in the high-single digits, up from a previous estimate for growth in the mid- to high-single digits.\\nDividend Yield Is Low, But Payouts Are Consistent\\nThis positive momentum really bodes well for Nike’s faithful investors, who have relied on the company’s dividend payments and understand the cyclical nature of its business. Nike stock currently pays $0.20 per share on a quarterly basis, translating to an annual dividend yield of 1%.\\nThat yield obviously doesn’t look attractive when compared to other high-yielding stocks in the market. But analyzing stocks just based on their yields isn’t a good approach. The best dividend stocks are the ones whose payouts are raised regularly.\\nOn this metric, Nike has done a great job. It has hiked its payout for 14 consecutive years, meaning Nike has the financial power to successfully ride through downturns and recessions, such as the one we saw in 2008 that forced many consumer cyclicals to suspend their payouts and seek government-sponsored bailouts.\\nRising dividends is a good reason for income investors to hold onto Nike stock without worrying too much about quarterly performance. Those that did have been handsomely rewarded. Since the start of 2008, Nike stock has gained 461% in value, including re-invested dividends.\\nBottom Line\\nTo balance the risk from interest-sensitive sectors, you should also hold stocks that tend to do well when rates rise and the economy is going strong. Nike is one of those low-risk stocks that have an impressive track record of performing well in many economic cycles. This is not a bad time to include this powerful brand in your income portfolio. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nHopes of a sustained market rebound faded on Friday as renewed concerns of global growth pressured markets. Oil prices tumbled and fresh fears of a U.S.-China trade war weighed on everything from technology to materials to energy shares.\\nIn this uncertain environment it’s hard to predict how the stock market will perform during the remaining weeks of 2018. Nevertheless, there's still one sector which has the potential to infuse some enthusiasm—retail.\\nIn the coming week, investors will hear from some of the nation’s largest retailers about current consumer spending trends and their expectations for the most important holiday season, which is just round the corner. Here are the three most closely watched, key earning releases for this upcoming week.\\n1. Macy’s\\nMacy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) is scheduled to report third quarter 2018 earnings before markets open on Wednesday, November 14. Consensus expectations are for an EPS of $0.13 on revenue of $5.44 billion. But even if the omni-channel retailer beats, it may not be enough to satisfy investors.\\nMacy's Weekly\\nMacy’ stock, which closed on Friday at $37.78, is up about over 30% this year. It's already reflecting positive expectations, as the department store chain continues to expand, as it's done for the past three quarters.\\nSome of the biggest line items on which investors will be focusing include the retailer's control over spending, online sales, and same store sales growth. There might be a significant jump in Macy’s shares if the company is able to show sustained upward momentum in its earnings.\\nThis would validate the strategic moves Macy's has made this year, such as acquiring the concept store Story, taking a minority stake in the innovative tech retailer B8ta, and expanding its off-price Backstage outlets. Investors will be looking for signs indicating how these efforts have helped the retailer's turnaround strategy.\\n2. Walmart\\nWith consumer confidence near all-time highs, America’s largest retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), is expected report another blowout quarter when it reports earnings on Thursday, November 15, before the market opens. Consensus predicts EPS of $1.02 on revenue of $124.83.\\nWMT Weekly\\nIn anticipation of strong earnings and growing online sales, investors have pushed Walmart shares up 20% from this year’s low of just under $82, to 98.59, where it closed on Friday.\\nIn the previous quarter, Walmart reported its strongest sales gain in more than a decade, fueled by its grocery business. Comparable sales at U.S. Walmart stores rose 4.5% in the three months ended in July, more than double analyst estimates. At that time, the world’s biggest retailer also boosted its full-year forecasts for comparable sales and adjusted profit.\\n3.Nvidia\\nNow is one of the worst times to own chipmaker shares. The semiconductor sector is going through a cyclical downturn as chip demand wanes and the U.S.-China trade war threatens their future growth outlook.\\nNVDA Weekly\\nInvestors will be focusing on Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) revenue and performance in gaming and data centers when the chipmaker reports fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday, November 15 after the market closes. Expectations are for them to report an EPS $1.73 on revenue of $3.24 billion.\\nNvidia shares have been one of the hardest hit in this downturn, plunging 30% from the stock's record high of $293 this year; shares closed at $205.67 on Friday. In a recent note to investors, JPMorgan upgraded the stock saying the company's long-term growth potential in different segments, including cloud data centers and autonomous driving, makes it an attractive stock to own. If the release is positive, and forward guidance favorable, buy-and-hold investors may see this level as a good entry point. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nReports Thursday, November 1, after the market closes\\nRevenue Expectation: $61.43 B\\nEPS: $2.78\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world\\'s most valuable company, is reporting its fourth quarter 2018 earnings today, and there\\'s no doubt that the world is watching.\\nFor Apple investors, as well as its stock, there are two things that matter most these days: Improving sales through higher prices and diversifying its revenue base away from iPhones. In the short-run, the company is having remarkable success on both these fronts.\\n1. Improving Sales Through Higher Prices\\nA year after increasing its flagship iPhone price to $999, in the last quarter, Apple has reported higher growth in sales. While iPhone volumes didn\\'t rise much, strong iPhone X demand helped increase the iconic smartphone\\'s average selling price (ASP) by $118, taking it up to $724, propelled total iPhone revenue growth higher by 20%.\\nThis week’s launch of new computer models such as Mac personal computers and redesigned iPads, point to a similar strategy. The company is raising prices substantially on these new versions, betting on the loyalty of its costumers, making them willing to pay more for Apple products. The price of the MacBook Air was raised by 20%, the Mac mini by 60%, and the iPad Pro by about 25%.\\n2. Diversifying Its Revenue Base Away From iPhones\\nThe other part of Apple’s strategy to grow sales amid slowing smartphone volume is to reduce its reliance on the iPhone. By increasing the revenue share from its services and \"other products\" segments, the company believes it can still grow at the robust pace investors have come to expect.\\nIndeed, so far, this divergence is deepening. Both Apple\\'s services and “other product” segments have grown in the last quarter, up 30%. While those businesses may eventually offset the slowing growth of the iPhone, we believe that Apple still has the power to fetch higher prices for its flagship devices without diminishing demand in a significant way.\\nDaily Apple Chart: March 2018-Present\\nThat’s the main reason that Apple shares have performed much better in the current tech sell-off, outperforming other tech giants. At the time of writing, its stock, which closed yesterday at $218.86 was down just 6% from the $233.47 peak it hit in early October.\\nOn average, analysts polled by FactSet expect Apple to post revenue for the past quaerter of $61.43 billion, up 17% from the same period a year ago, and GAAP EPS of $2.78, for the same year-ago period, a gain of 34%.\\nBottom Line\\nDespite some deterioration in the macro environment this year, we don’t see any threat to Apple\\'s $1 trillion valuation, nor to its growth momentum. In fact, the company\\'s stock is the net beneficiary of funds flow from social media stocks to the hardware giants.\\nCompanies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are under pressure because of data privacy issues. Apple, which is immune from this scrutiny, is well-positioned to attract those outflows based on the strength of its business and the attraction of its massive capital return program, in the shape of dividends and share buybacks.\\nDespite all the current market noise, buying and holding Apple shares remains a winning strategy. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nIt's never a bad time to start preparing for your retirement. The reality in this perpetually low interest-rate environment is that retirees need to have a good chunk of their portfolio tied to stocks to earn higher total returns.\\nConservative investors who don’t want to add too much risk to their portfolios will need to identify good quality stocks that have the ability to recover from downturns and still continue to provide a regular income.\\n\\nIn the dividend-paying segment of the market, sometimes it makes sense to focus on what some traders may view as boring, old-economy businesses, such as power and gas utilities, key infrastructure providers, and banks and insurance companies — companies that go on paying dividends through the thick and thin of the market.\\n1.Toronto Dominion Bank\\nCanadian banks are among the best dividend-paying stocks in North America. What makes them different from their peers south of the border is less competition, a sound regulatory environment, and their diversification.They operate in a kind of oligopoly where competition is limited, and the regulatory environment is extremely favorable for growth. Canada’s top lenders have been very consistent in rewarding investors through steadily growing dividends, on which they spend about 40%-50% of their income. In this group, I particularly like Toronto Dominion Bank (TSX:TD), Canada’s second-largest lender. It has a very attractive dividend policy, supported by strong growth momentum, and a significant retail-banking operation in the U.S. Indeed, TD has more retail branches in the U.S. than in Canada, with a network that stretches from Maine to Florida.Overall, TD generates about 30% of its net income from its U.S. retail operations. The bank also has a 42% ownership stake in TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) with a fast-expanding credit card portfolio.Toronto Dominion Bank price chartAfter a 10.4% increase in its payout in February, income investors in TD stock now earn a $0.56-a-share quarterly dividend, which translates into a 3.86% yield. The bank is forecast to grow its dividend payout between 7% and 10% each year going forward — an impressive growth rate at a time when the 10-year government note is yielding less than 1.69%. TD stock, after gaining 16% this year, was trading at $57.68 at close yesterday.\\n\\n2. Dow Inc.\\nThe newly established Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW), after its recent spin-off from parent DowDuPont Inc., is offering a very attractive income-generating opportunity for retirees.\\n\\nDow shares began trading on April 1 after the old  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DD) announced a grand $120-billion merger in 2017, with an intention to create three separate entities, focusing on agricultural products and a specialty chemicals company.\\n\\nThe third one became Dow, entirely focusing on material sciences, plastics and silicones. What makes it a compelling income-generating opportunity is the chemical producer’s clear focus to return most of its income back to investors in the shape of dividends and share buybacks. According to the company’s presentation to investors, the new Dow will pay out 65% of its net income to shareholders each year through stock buybacks and a hefty dividend.\\nIts stock currently pays $0.7 dividend a share, with an annual yield of about 5.8%. With the targeted payout ratio of 45% of the company’s net operating income, that dividend is quite conservative.\\nDow price chart\\n\\n\\n\\nThat said, investors should be aware that plastic, being a derivative of oil, is a cyclical business where demand and supply is closely tied to the global economic growth and other macro influences. That’s the reason that its stock fell about 4% this year as trade fight between the U.S. and China hurt demand for industrial products. Its stock closed yesterday at $47.91.\\n3. Enbridge Inc.Utilities is another area where you can get a good income stream if you remain invested for the long-run. North America’s largest pipeline operator, Enbridge Inc (NYSE:ENB) could be a good fit for your income-generating portfolio, with its massive moat and its crucial position in North America’s energy supply chain.\\nEnbridge is also a good defensive stock to hold on to when the economic headwinds are gathering pace. The company pays $0.55 a share quarterly dividend with an annual dividend yield of 6.28%. The payout is expected to rise 10% per year as the company completes its many development projects and benefits from Canada’s very tight pipeline capacity.\\nOver the past two years, Enbridge has been carrying out a restructuring plan, selling assets, focusing on its core strengths, and paying down its debt. These measures are likely to benefit long-term investors whose aim is to earn steadily growing income.\\nEnbridge price chart\\n\\n\\n\\nEnbridge stock, up 13% to date in 2019, closed at $35.15 yesterday in New York.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAdding solid dividend stocks to a portfolio could create a sustained income stream to rely on during retirement. Investors should slowly start building their portfolios when the prices are attractive. If they continue to re-invest payouts to buy more shares of these companies, they'll thus also unlock the powerful process of compounding. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nBetting on top oil stocks has always been risky. The biggest challenge investors face when evaluating energy stocks is correctly predicting the direction of oil markets.\\nThis, of course, is an almost impossible task given the extremely volatile nature of the commodity. Even if you’re a long-term energy bull, picking the right stock from among the energy \"supermajors\" has become more complicated given the uncertain, long-term, demand-supply outlook alongside the rising use of renewables, electric cars and a global push to curb climate change.\\nThe performance of ExxonMobil shares reflects this challenging operating environment for the oil giants.\\nXOM Weekly 2015-2018\\nThe stock has fallen 8% this year even as the price of brent crude has increased almost 50% from a year earlier.\\nLooking to add some oil and gas exposure to your portfolio? Should ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), the world\\'s largest publicly traded oil producer, be on your list?\\nIf your goal is to take short-term gains on rebounding oil prices, we don’t think Exxon is a good choice.\\nDifferent Growth Strategy\\nExxonMobil has taken a long-term approach to improve its growth outlook, diverging from other large producers who are trying to stabilize their share prices by refraining from boosting major spending, instead putting more cash into investor pockets via share buybacks. Irrespective of bleak oil demand forecasts, Exxon CEO Darren Woods believes the oil and gas industry needs trillions of dollars of fresh investment to meet global demand for energy products by 2040.\\nWith this in mind, Exxon is initiating one of the biggest expansions in its corporate history, spending $200-billion over the next seven years on low-cost mega-projects that will help maintain the company\\'s dominance in oil and natural gas markets for decades. As part of this plan, Exxon will increase its currently minimal oil production in the U.S. Permian Basin five-fold, plus start 25 projects worldwide, which will add more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day to the company\\'s production volume. In 2017, ExxonMobil added 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.\\nIf all this materializes, and the price of oil remains around $60 a barrel, Exxon’s management expects the company will be able to double earnings by 2025. In the short-term, however, this impressive long-term growth plan has been a major drag on the company’s shares this year.\\nAt a time when other integrated producers such as Chevron (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa), are increasing share buybacks and returning more cash to investors, Exxon is the only supermajor which didn\\'t announce a share buyback program. Exxon shares have barely moved this year, while Chevron and Shell delivered 9% and 13% respectively in returns.\\nThe company’s recent earnings also failed to cheer investors. The producer failed to meet expectations on earnings, cash flow, debt and output. Exxon also cut its full-year production target to the equivalent of 3.8 million barrels of crude from last year’s 4 million barrel output.\\nBottom Line \\nIf you’re looking to play the strength of oil markets in the recent cycle, we don’t think Exxon stock is an appropriate pick for you. To play this trade, you’re better off buying U.S.-based pure refiners, companies such as Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC).\\nPhillips 66, for example, beat analyst expectations for the second quarter, more than doubling its earnings from a year earlier with 100% utilization at the company’s fuel processing plants. Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum also beat expectations.\\nExxon, on the other hand, is most appealing for long-term investors whose goal would be to lock in growing dividend income. The company has a diversified portfolio of assets that provide a superior hedge against the swings in oil prices. Exxon has increased its dividend payout every year for the past 36 years. With its 4.26% annual dividend yield—the highest since the mid-1990’s—Exxon stock, which closed yesterday at $77.93, is still a bargain for the buy-and-hold investors. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nMacy’s CEO Jeff Gennette believes this is the winning formula for the beleaguered department store: a healthy brick and mortar business, robust e-commerce and a great mobile experience.\\nFor two consecutive quarters that formula has produced stunning results. Macy’s (NYSE:M) blew past analysts’ sales expectations, raised its full-year forecast for same-store sales and won the confidence of the market. The stock is up more than 50% this year, the second-best performance after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\\nMacy's Weekly Chart\\nBut it’s tough to call the two-quarter win a trend, given the retailer’s disastrous performance during the past three years. Macy’s fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, August 15 will give us more evidence to see if this turnaround is for real.\\nThe retailer is forecast to report second-quarter revenue of $5.55 billion, down just slightly from the year-ago period, and earnings per share of $0.50, up from $0.48.\\nSo far, the linchpin of Macy’s turnaround strategy has been to improve its digital presence, close its underperforming stores and sell some of its real estate. The company is also investing heavily in its Bluemercury chain of specialty beauty stores and discount outlet Macy's (NYSE:M) Backstage.\\nThese changes have been successful in bringing in more customers, both at stores and online. In the fiscal first quarter, the retailer reported earnings per diluted share of $0.45, an improvement from $0.26 in the same period a year ago. Comparable-store sales also rose by 3.9% for owned stores and 4.2% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.\\nStill A Lot of Work To Do\\nIt’s digital that is winning over customers and Wall Street. Macy's is one of the two department store chains that let customers check prices on its app, track order history, do visual searches for products and chat with customer representatives.\\nThe strength of its e-commerce activity shows that the retailer is well-positioned to defend its turf against much bigger rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT). Macy’s digital sales have been growing at a double-digit pace for the past few quarters.\\nBut we feel that Macy's still has a lot to do at a time when the traditional departmental stores are being attacked from all fronts. Besides the existential threat that Amazon poses to the brick-and-mortar model, some off-price giants such as TJX (NYSE:TJX) and Wayfair (NYSE:W) are putting up strong competition in home renovation categories.\\nTrading close to the $40 a share, we see Macy’s stock is already reflecting all the positive news that came with the first round of fixes that were relatively easy to make. Entering in the game when Macy’s stock is trading close to the 52-week high is very risky.\\nShare will be a long-term buy once the company shows consistent improvements in its same-store sales and once its bottom line is free from the boost it’s receiving from real-estate sales. Until then, it’s better for investors to wait on the sidelines. At these levels, the stock is highly vulnerable to any negative surprise. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe past week has been painful for retail giant Macy's (NYSE:M). Investors saw the value of their shares plummet despite the department store chain delivering solid second quarter earnings and raising its full year guidance.\\nMacy's 300 Minute Chart\\nThe embattled retailer reported on August 15 that comparable store earnings, including business in departments it licenses to third parties and its e-commerce segment, rose 0.5%, beating the 1% drop Wall Street had expected. Macy’s also raised its full year sales growth forecast to between $3.95 and $4.15 a share, excluding some items.\\nGrowth, however, comes at a cost for this retailer. Macy’s executives warned that gross margins are expected to decline in the second half of the year compared with the first half, on higher costs associated with the company’s new loyalty program.\\nStill, beneath the surface there's solid evidence that Macy’s turnaround plan remains on track and is already showing positive results. The company’s spending to improve its digital presence—by adding more local merchandise and refreshing in-store fixtures—is helping to bring in more store traffic even while boosting online sales.\\nIn the second quarter, Macy's digital sales rose by 10%, for the 36th straight quarter. The retailer expects to exceed $1 billion in mobile sales this year.\\nRight now, Macy's is just one of the two department store chains that let customers check prices on its app, track order history, do visual searches for products and also chat with customer representatives. The strength of its e-commerce activity shows that the retailer is well-positioned to defend its turf against much bigger rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT).\\nWinning Turnaround Formula\\nChief Executive Officer Jeff Gennett’s winning formula—a healthy bricks-and-mortar business, robust e-commerce and a great customer experience via mobile—has all the necessary ingredients to sustain the company’s turnaround momentum. On the bricks-and-mortar front, Macy’s has taken a number of concrete steps that are improving the sales outlook.\\nIt closed many of its non-profitable locations and is selling some of its valuable real estate to generate cash. Its Growth50 initiative, a plan to revamp some of its stores with new merchandising efforts and improved fixtures and facilities, has been a success. It also lays the groundwork for a broader restructuring of the business.\\nThe company is also investing heavily in its Bluemercury chain of specialty beauty stores as well as its discount outlet, Macy's Backstage.\\nFrom a macro perspective, the environment looks very supportive for Macy’s to continue on this upward growth trajectory. With the currently strong employment situation and attendant wage growth, consumers should continue to spend more.\\nBottom Line\\nMacy’s bears may view all this differently. For them, the company’s turnaround strategy might not be dynamic enough to ensure the store's long-term survival, given the massive disruption that’s taking place in the retail space.\\nMacy's Weekly 2017-2018\\nIf that theory is correct, then this is probably the right time for investors to cash out after a massive rally in the retailer's share price over the past one year. Even after the 14% plunge on the day of of its earnings report, Macy’s shares are still up over 100% in one year, having bounced back from their five-year low or $18.37 reached in late October.\\nAt $38.24 as of last night's close, Macy’s stock is trading at about 11 times earnings, with a 4% annual dividend yield. This valuation looks compelling if you compare this price-to-earnings ratio with other retailers, such as Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST). and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) which have P/E ratios of 24.20 and 20.25 respectively.\\nThat said, we think Macy’s stock already reflects all the positive news from its first round of fixes, which were relatively easy to make. Entering in the game when Macy’s stock is trading close to the 52-week high is highly risky. For those who already own this stock, we don’t think this is the right time to book gains. A healthy consumer spending environment and the company’s turnaround strategy are likely to fuel more gains in the second half of this year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nOver the past year, investors have been wary of banking stocks, and for good reason. As the stock market extended it longest bull run in US history, the country's largest financial companies were left behind. Indeed, their shares seriously underperformed other sectors.\\nBut that period of lagging performance for bank stocks could be a thing of the past. Earnings reports for the third quarter show that some of the biggest US banks are beginning to reap the benefits of an economy in which consumer sentiment is healthy, companies are borrowing to expand, and credit losses have been minimal.\\nYesterday, two of the US's biggest banks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) produced better than expected third-quarter results. Goldman’s profit surged 19%, while Morgan Stanley reported that its bottom line improved 17%.\\nWhat's more, last week, JPMorgan & Chase (NYSE:JPM) also beat analyst estimates, posting a 24% rise in profit, boosted by strength from its consumer business which offset weak trading results. These robust earnings provide strong evidence that for the first time since the 2008 Financial Crisis, the US's largest banks are one again well positioned to reward investors.\\nBut though banks are beginning to look attractive again, some offer a better risk-reward equation than others. If you're looking to reenter this sector, we think Citigroup (NYSE:C) is one of the best banking stocks to own right now.\\nCitigroup: Laggard Ripe for a Rebound\\nMonthly Citigroup Chart: 1993-2018\\nWhen it comes to judging banks based םמ their share performance since the 2008 Financial Crisis, Citigroup has been a laggard. Its stock is still down more than 60% since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September of that year, making it the worst performing bank among US majors, by far.\\nDespite this, Citi's latest earnings report, released this past Friday, shows that the lender is headed in the right direction after years of cost-cutting and re-balancing. In the third quarter, the New York-based lender posted a 12% surge in profits, to $4.62 billion. Earnings per share were $1.73, beating analyst expectations of $1.69 a share.\\nOperating expenses fell 1%, surprising expectations and indicating that the company is on its way to meeting financial targets for this year. Citi also showed an improvement in the yield from its North America Citi branded credit card business. Analysts were watching this metric closely and the improvement adds another positive point for Citi's profit outlook.\\nBut the brightest factor that makes Citigroup a great banking stock to bet on is CEO Michael Corbat’s success at sustainably cutting costs for the past six years. These efforts are reflected in the lender’s rapidly improving efficiency ratio, or expenses as a percentage of revenue. This metric has come in at less than 60% for the past three years, making it the only major bank able to maintain such a winning streak.\\nAnother factor making Citigroup stock a better pick than its peers is the lender’s aggressive capital return plan. This year Citigroup hiked its quarterly dividend by $0.13 to $0.45, for a current yield of 2.60%, and announced its intention to return $17.6 billion to investors via stock buybacks.\\nDuring the third quarter, Citi returned $6.4 billion of capital to common shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Finally, over the past 12 months, the lender has cut its common shares outstanding by over 200 million, or 8%.\\nBottom Line\\nOn its valuation metrics, it’s tough to come up with a banking stock that has greater appeal than Citigroup. Shares don't trade at a premium to the book value of its assets like almost all of its peers.\\nCurrently trading at $69.71, Citigroup is one of the cheapest picks among the big financial names. In an environment where interest rates are rising and the US economy is showing strength, Citigroup’s stock can only get better from here. Its place at the bottom of the pack is what makes Citi ripe for a powerful rally. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Consensus calls for $5.14 EPS on $5.44 billion in revenue.\\nAVGO Weekly TTM\\nThe latest downturn in the semiconductor industry has hit some producers hard, but Broadcom seems to be weathering the storm quite well. Its shares, which closed on Friday at $291.91, are up about 26% over the past one year, even as the Semiconductor Index rose about 15%.\\nWhat's exciting investors about Broadcom is the company's current strategy, spearheaded by its CEO Hock Tan, to grow through acquisitions and buy software assets that are struggling but have growth potential. Last month, the company announced it was acquiring Symantec Corporation's (NASDAQ:SYMC) enterprise security division, which produces software to keep hackers out of corporate systems, for $10 billion.\\nThe acquisition marks Broadcom’s second big bet in software, following its $19 billion takeover of CA Technologies last year. After these deals, more than 80% of Broadcom’s sales will now be derived from more stable and sustainable businesses such as cloud, networking, software and storage segments.\\n2. The Kroger Co.Supermarket behemoth, Kroger (NYSE:KR) will report its second quarter earnings on Thursday as well, before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.41 a share profit for the period ended June 30 on sales of $28.4 billion.\\nKR Weekly TTM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShares of Kroger have fallen 24% during the past one year amid investor concerns that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and other rivals are taking market share from the Cincinnati-based grocery chain which is struggling to put together a winning strategy in this tough competitive environment.\\nIn the first quarter, its same store sales missed analyst projections, while profit margins decreased because of investments the company has been making to keep pace with the competition. To defend its turf, the largest U.S. supermarket chain acquired Home Chef, a meal kit company and expanded its partnership with Instacart, a San Francisco-based, same-day grocery delivery service which operates in some areas of the U.S.\\n3. Aurora Cannabis Aurora Cannabis  (NYSE:ACB), (TSX:ACB), one of the largest marijuana producers, will report Q4 2019 earnings on Wednesday Sept. 11, after the close. Analysts are forecasting a loss of $0.04 a share on sales of $81.56 million.\\nACB Weekly TTM\\n\\n\\n\\nLast month, Aurora said its saleable production during the fourth quarter was at the high end of its previous guidance, or perhaps even above. The Edmonton-based company is expecting its revenue from all sources will rise to between $100-$107 million, but it didn't provide an estimate on fourth quarter earnings.\\nMarijuana companies are coming under greater scrutiny as they struggle to achieve profitability after Canada legalized recreational use of cannabis last year. Trading around $6 a share, Aurora shares have lost more than 20% of their value this year, amid a widespread sector sell-off that pushed the stocks of many top cannabis producers sharply lower.\\nAurora operates in 21 countries with a strong presence in the European Union. The company announced early this year that billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is joining Aurora as a strategic adviser. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nInvesting in gold is a pure bet on the economy. The precious metal hit a six-year high this month as central banks globally eased their monetary policy to deal with the slowdown in growth triggered by the U.S.-China trade war.\\nThe events of the past six months have supported a bull run in gold, which is considered a safe-haven asset during times of economic turbulence. The U.S. and China trade dispute escalated, the European economy slowed, Brexit became ever messier and tension in the Middle East flared up after the attacks on the largest oil-producing nation, Saudi Arabia.\\nGold Futures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese macro setbacks raised the possibility of a recession and forced the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates. On Sept. 18, the Fed acted again and lowered the borrowing cost by another quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.75% to 2%.\\nEncouraged by these signals, gold bulls moved their cash to gold and silver miners, sparking a rally in mining stocks. BlackRock's iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners (NASDAQ:RING), has returned almost 14% in August, more than any other unleveraged stock fund in the U.S., data compiled by Bloomberg show.\\nXAU/USD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGold at a Record High?\\nGoing forward, however, the big question for investors in gold assets is whether this rally has legs, or we are at the peak of this bullish trend. According to a recent note by Citigroup’s analysts, the outlook for gold is quite healthy as they see a possibility of prices rallying to a record above $2,000 an ounce in the next two years.That rally, according to analysts including Aakash Doshi will be supported by drivers such as the rising risk of a global recession and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will reduce U.S. interest rates to zero.“We expect spot gold prices to trade stronger for longer, possibly breaching $2,000 an ounce and posting new cyclical highs at some point in the next year or two,” they said. If that level was reached, it would exceed the record of $1,921.17 set in 2011.But the risks to this bullish scenario are equally strong. Both U.S. and China are back at the negotiation table in October and the markets are returning to normal on hopes of a resolution to their dispute.On the economic front, the U.S. economy is still showing signs of strength, helped by robust consumer spending, and strong job creation. That was the main reason why the Fed failed to signal that more cuts were coming. FOMC officials are divided over whether more cuts will be needed, with some of them thinking Wednesday’s change was itself a cut too far.\\nGold Stocks to Buy\\nIn this highly uncertain economic environment, it’s probably not a bad idea to keep some exposure to gold in your portfolio. If the gold rally is sustained and prices continue to climb higher, gold miners who have taken steps to cut costs and capital expenditures over the past few years stand to benefit the most, making them an attractive alternative in any long-term portfolio.\\nIn this group, we like Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM), now the world’s largest gold miner, and the Canadian producer Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). These are among the producers who learned a hard lesson during the metal’s last bull surge.\\nNewmont Goldcorp/Barrick Gold price charts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrices in the spot market reached a record $1,921.17 in 2011, but the rally collapsed quickly as historically low interest rates and quantitative easing by central banks fueled gains in the equity market and economic growth accelerated. By the end of 2015, prices had tumbled about 45%.\\nNow that bullion is back in favor, many miners are playing it safe by going for organic growth and optimizing existing assets. They've gone through sustained cost cutting, debt reduction and boosts in productivity after the last slump to lure back investors.\\nThe shares of Newmont, at $39.30, are up about 14% this year, while Barrick Gold had surged 38% to $18.17.\\nBottom Line\\nInvesting in gold-linked stocks, such as BlackRock’s Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or top gold miners, is a risky proposition due to many opposing dynamics that could push the precious metal in either direction. That being said, gold’s haven status is intact and it can provide a great hedge when other assets are plunging. In the current uncertain economic environment, the precious metal offers a prudent way to diversify your risk and add some safety to your portfolio. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nAlibaba\\'s (NYSE:BABA) technical chart looks downright ugly, and it comes at a time when some of its fundamentals aren\\'t looking too good either. Founder Jack Ma has announced he will hand over the reins as chairman to current CEO Daniel Zhang within a year.\\nThe Chinese e-commerce giant has lost about a quarter of its value since reaching a record high in June. This massive plunge has thrown the long-term bull case into doubt for a company that controls 58% of the Chinese e-commerce market.\\nBABA Weekly 2015-2018\\nThere are many triggers for this sudden downfall. The most important one, which is not specific to Alibaba, is the escalating trade war between China and the US, the world’s two largest economies. Many investors fear President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs on Chinese imports will hurt the Chinese economy badly.\\nIn the latest development, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $467 billion worth of imports from China, after tit-for-tat $100 billion duties that both countries announced this summer. If the president follows through, the threatened tariffs and those already in place would more than cover the $505 billion of Chinese products the US imported in 2017. Due to the colossal nature of these measures, investors are currently shunning Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite index is currently in a bear market, down about 26% from its 52-week high.\\nBeyond trade tensions, Chinese internet stocks are also facing a tough operating environment locally. Regulators’ crackdown on social media, streaming video and online gaming have weighed on the nation’s largest internet stocks. Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) for example, the Chinese equivalent of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is down more than 20% this year.\\nEarnings Momentum Slowing\\nAlibaba stock, however, also has a couple of other problems that are making investors nervous. To begin with, its earnings momentum seems to be slowing down, pressured by heavy investments the company is making to build scale in Southeast Asia, a region that’s central to its global growth.\\nIn its fiscal first quarter report on August 23, Alibaba reported earnings that fell short of analysts’ expectations, while operating margins came under pressure on escalating costs. Net income declined 40.8% from the fiscal first quarter of 2017, while adjusted earnings per share came in at 8.04 yuan vs. 8.15 yuan expected.\\nOperating profit took a big hit, dropping 54% to 8 billion yuan ($1.16 billion). Alibaba cited the cost of share-based compensation at its affiliate company Ant Financial (formerly Alipay), which it said increased by 11 billion yuan for the period. If not for that expense, operating income would have climbed 9%, it said.\\nAccording to Alibaba’s guidance during its earnings release, the pressure on operating margins will continue:\\n\\n\"As many of our newly developed and acquired businesses have different cost structures, we expect that our margin will continue to be negatively impacted by these businesses and the accounting treatment of revenue recorded on a gross basis.\"\\n\\nOn the brighter side, Alibaba\\'s sales surged 61% in the quarter, helped by its new growth drivers, such as cloud computing and entertainment. But on its bottom line, these businesses played a big role in the margin compression. These divisions lost money a year ago and they lost even more money in the latest quarter, with little sign that significant revenue growth is translating into improved profitability.\\nBottom Line\\nThe near-term future of the stock depends on the resolution of trade disputes and how quickly both countries involved are able to strike a deal. Over the long run, however, we remain bullish on Alibaba. It provides unique exposure to the world’s second-largest economy as well as Asia’s other emerging markets.\\nThe consensus in the market is that Alibaba shares will rebound once the geopolitical issues are resolved and Chinese stocks began to once again trade on their actual fundamentals. The majority of analysts on Wall Street have a buy rating on Alibaba, with an average $230.35 price target, implying about a 32% upside potential from yesterday\\'s $157 close.\\nRegardless of the short term targets, we believe Alibaba is the sort of stock buy-and-hold investors could consider on every dip. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) offered its bulls some powerful ammunition this week. The maker of the popular iPhone showed how it can use its massive base of customers to unlock new areas of growth when demand for its flagship products is weakening.\\nIn a major shift to its growth strategy, Apple on Monday unveiled a suite of new services, including a new video-subscription service which will carry its original content; an Apple credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS); a news app providing access to 300-plus magazines as well as newspapers, and a gaming subscription service offering access to 100-plus exclusive games. Aiming to disrupt a host of different industries, Apple is showing it hasn’t yet finished its super growth cycle and it is ideally positioned to use its 1.4-billion active installed base to diversify its revenue.\\nThe most important part of this strategic shift is Apple’s foray into the highly competitive video-streaming service arena, where it will be competing with the much established rival, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and traditional media operators, such as Disney (NYSE:DIS). Apple TV Plus will be ad-free, available on demand, and viewable both online and offline.\\nApple plans to launch it in over 100 countries this fall. So far, it hasn’t disclosed how much it will charge for the service.\\nOn the consumer finance side, Apple Card won’t have common charges such as annual, foreign-transaction and late fees, further increasing the appeal of its Apple Pay feature.\\nNo Longer Just About iPhones\\nApple’s new moves are consistent with our view that Apple isn’t just about iPhones and that it has a lot of options at its disposal to arrest a slowdown in its hardware business. With this optimistic outlook, the biggest question for investors, however, is whether they should remain loyal to Apple shares when its CEO Tim Cook is making the biggest bet of his career after Steve Jobs’ death in 2011?\\nThe company's stock, after touching a record high of $233.47 in October, has fallen about 18%, underperforming the S&P 500. In the last month, however, it's gained 7.5% and is up 8% over the past year. The shares closed yesterday at $186.79.\\nApple Weekly Chart\\nGiven the momentum Apple's services unit has shown during the past five years, we believe Apple is on the right track and long-term investors will be rewarded for their patience. The company’s services, which includes Apple Music, movie rentals and app downloads, produced 33% growth last year  with sales touching $40 billion—accounting for about 15% of the company’s total of $265.6 billion.\\nThat contribution to Apple’s total sales, according to an estimate by Morgan Stanley, will continue to grow and could generate about 60% of Apple’s revenue in the next five years.\\nNo doubt, Apple’s journey to make services business its top revenue generator won’t be an easy one. It’s entering the media entertainment game at a time when Netflix has won 139 million global subscribers through its enticing content, while Disney, which has decades of experience making hit shows and movies, plans to launch its own streaming service later this year, armed with its newly acquired 21st Century Fox's media assets.\\nBut what makes Apple different is the company’s deep pockets and its highly loyal customer base. A slowdown in the company’s iPhone business doesn’t mean that the smartphone industry is dying. Even if we assume that Apple has seen the best days of its iPhone growth, it will still be a great cash-cow business, providing Apple a wide economic moat to branch out to other areas.\\nBottom Line\\nFor long-term investors whose objective is to earn a decent return through dividends and capital appreciation, we find Apple a very suitable candidate. The company is returning more and more cash to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\\nSlowing iPhone sales and the company’s investments to accelerate growth in its services business might keep the stock depressed in the short-run, but we think investors will be better off remaining invested to capture the upside that will come with its renewed focus on services. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUS equity markets have finished Q3 on a strong note. In fact it was the best quarter in five years as stocks continued their upward move, helped by strong earnings, a robust US economy and an increasingly firm job market.\\nGoing forward, the horizon looks clear. There's no sign of a major storm that could thwart this longest bull-run in US history by some measures. Investors have begun to ignore the US-China trade war which still has the potential to slow the Chinese economy and raise prices on some consumer items in the US.\\nStill, with markets likely to continue their advances this coming week, there remain some trouble spots in the technology space that could dampen investor sentiment. Here are three large cap stocks to watch for unusual moves:\\n1. Facebook\\nThe crisis of confidence in the world’s largest social media platform, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), took another ugly turn on Friday when the company disclosed that an unknown number of hackers obtained login access to as many as 50 million accounts. That access let the intruders act like users in the hacked profiles, or on any applications where they signed in using Facebook.\\nFB Weekly 2015-2018\\nThis latest breach follows the devastating Cambridge Analytica scandal and allegations that Russian operators used the platform to influence the US elections. It could further shatter user confidence in the social media giant.\\nFacebook shares fell more than 2% after the news broke, extending the stock's slide from a record high of $218.62 in late July to $164.46, where it closed on Friday. To date, FB shares have lost a quarter of their value since their high.\\nThe extent of the damage to Facebook's reputation from this latest data breach is hard to quantify at this point. It’s unclear what the hackers did with the access and who they were or whom they were trying to target. In this uncertain environment, the company's shares will remain vulnerable and losses could extend. Investors should wait to hear what Mark Zuckerberg has to say about this latest infringement.\\n2. Tesla\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)—the company and the stock—is in the middle of a firestorm after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to sue CEO and Chairman Elon Musk for securities fraud based on his tweet last month that told investors he had secured funding to take the company private. In its suit, the SEC sought unspecified monetary penalties and asked a judge to bar Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company, the agency said in a lawsuit filed in New York last week.\\nTSLA Weekly 2015-2018\\nMusk misled investors by claiming falsely that he had lined up funding for the transaction, the suit alleges. Musk, reportedly initially refused to settle with the securities’ regulator to get the charges removed. He called the lawsuit a “distraction” in an e-mail sent to his employees, according to Bloomberg News, telling them to focus on the production of Model 3 sedan which is crucial for the company’s financial success.\\nHowever, on Saturday, news broke that Musk had reached a settlement with the SEC, which allowed him to remain as CEO of the embattled auto manufacturer, though he'll be required to resign from his position as chairman for three years. The ongoing drama surrounding Musk personally has caused investors to loose faith in his leadership. Indeed, Tesla stock plunged 14% on the SEC move. Even with yesterday's settlement—which could reduce some of the pressure on the stock, which closed at $264.77 on Friday, off 32% from its 52-week high of 387.46—TSLA shares are likely to remain volatile in the coming week.\\n3. Pepsi\\nSnack and beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) will report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the market opens. Analysts expect EPS of $1.56, up from $1.491 a share a year earlier, on revenues of $16.44B.\\nThe latest quarterly report will be the last for Indra Nooyi as CEO. She ran the company for 12 years and helped expand PepsiCo’s sales to $63 billion in an environment where consumers are shunning sugary drinks and adopting healthier options.\\nPEP Weekly 2015-2018\\nStrong sales of salty snacks, such as Frito-Lay chips, Tostitos and Ruffles, may continue to drive both top and bottom-line growth. These brands helped PepsiCo beat per-share profit estimates in the last quarter. A positive earnings surprise may help Pepsi shares move closer to the record high of $122.51 it reached early this year. The stock finished the week at $111.80 on Friday. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThough the final weeks of August are usually a quiet time for markets, this year there's no respite for investors—volatility is back and the future looks uncertain. Both the S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled on Friday after an unexpected escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.\\nWith a new round of tariffs from both China and the U.S. announced on Friday, the probability of this trade war becoming yet more ugly has increased, and so does the possibility of the U.S. economy falling into recession. These fears will likely keep stocks under pressure as investors avoid taking new positions while shunning riskier assets.\\nEven with the worsening economic backdrop, there will still be some new information to digest from a number of important companies, each scheduled to report quarterly earnings. Here are three stocks we're keeping in focus:\\n1. Dell Technologies\\nDell (NYSE:DELL) will release its fiscal 2020 second quarter results on Thursday, Aug. 29, after the market close. Analyst consensus expects earnings per share of $1.49 earnings on sales of $23.32 billion.\\nDuring its forecast for fiscal 2020, Dell had warned that sales growth will slow over the next year, hurt by the global economic issues that may weaken corporate demand for the company’s hardware products. Last year, Dell consistently generated strong hardware sales, as the company prepared to transition back to the public markets after five years of restructuring aimed at cutting back debt and simplifying a tangled corporate structure.\\nDELL Weekly TTM\\nInvestors liked the restructured Dell, sending its shares higher by 50% until late May this year. But its shares have been on a downward spiral since then, as the company reported sales for Q1 that fell short of Wall Street estimates, with weaker demand for its servers. The stock closed about 7% down on Friday at $45.81.\\nPerhaps adding to the company's woes, Dell’s business in China generates a high single-digit percentage of the company’s total revenue. Some customers in the country were delaying orders because of the U.S.-China trade war, according to Dell’s chief financial officer Tom Sweet.\\n2. Best Buy Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) is another high profile name that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week. The big box electronics and technology retailer reports Q2 earnings on Thursday, Aug. 29  before the market opens.\\nBBY Weekly TTM\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stock has rallied strongly this year, surging more than 25%, as Best Buy benefits from its expanding services business and its increasing assortment of smart-home devices, such as door locks and cameras, along with appliances, video games and wearable devices. Shares closed at $66.21 on Friday.\\nThat growth momentum may come under pressure, however, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company’s largest supplier, predicting a slowdown in sales this year and the U.S.- China tariff tit-for-tat escalating yet again, pushing the cost of electronic products higher. Best Buy relies heavily on China to source its large inventory of products. That could mean more pressure on retailers earnings and shares.\\nFor the second quarter of 2019, the company is likely to report EPS of $0.99, up from $0.91 a year ago. Revenue is likely to rise $9.79 billion according to analyst estimates.\\n3. TeslaTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to keep investors on edge as a flurry of bad news hit the stock last week. Shares plunged 5% on Friday, falling to $211.40, adding to the 19% plunge during the past one month alone.\\nTSLA Weekly TTM\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said a June 2018 blaze on the roof of one of its warehouses in Redlands, California, involved a solar panel system that Tesla’s SolarCity division had installed. News of the Amazon fire comes just three days after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) filed a lawsuit against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), accusing it of faulty panel installations that led to fires at more than a half-dozen stores.\\nThese claims put further pressure on Elon Musk who’s facing increasing criticism over his decisions and the bad financial situation at Tesla’s electric car division. In the second quarter, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) lost $1.12 a share, a bigger deficit than any analyst had projected.\\nThe earnings miss and departures of top executives in recent months are making investors nervous about Musk’s ability to turn this company profitable.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nInvesting in income-producing stocks is an ideal strategy for those seeking to earn extra cash during retirement. Of course, dividend-paying stocks aren't sexy, and the shares alone won't make you rich, but they often belong to a mature group of companies in stable markets that don’t stop returning cash to investors, often by boosting dividends, even during the worst economic times.\\nThe big challenge, though, is to identify the right stocks. One way is to focus on the high-quality companies in the S&P 500 with at least 25 years of dividend growth, known in the market as “Dividend Aristocrats.” While good historical performance doesn’t guarantee that companies in this group will continue to provide you cash streams going forward, this is still a much safer bet than picking names with no track record.\\nThe dividend stocks below are two examples we think are worth considering as additions to your retirement portfolio:\\n1. 3M: Cash Machine for Long-Term Investors\\nThe shares of one of the world's largest industrial conglomerates, 3M (NYSE:MMM), are certainly not a buy if your investing objective is to see quick gains and move on to the next growth stock. The future outlook for this industrial giant is becoming uncertain amid the many powerful headwinds threatening the global economy, and any prolonged economic weakness has the potential to hurt the demand for its products.\\nBut what if all you want is to earn steadily growing income? On this criteria, the maker of Post-it notes and touch screens has an excellent track-record. The company has raised its dividend every year between 1962 and 2018. This impressive run of dividend growth suggests that the company has the power to endure recessions, demand weakness and other turbulence along the way.\\nTrading at around $212 a share at yesterday's close, 3M stock is down about 17% from the record high reached in January last year on concerns that rising costs and a slowing global economy will hit its earnings. But this temporary slip also allows long-term income investors to lock-in its dividend yield of close to 3% and earn growing payouts year after year. The company will pay a quarterly dividend of $1.44 per share on March 12, up almost 6% from the $1.36 per share paid in the same period in 2018.\\n3M Weekly Chart\\n2. Procter & Gamble: Owner of Powerful Consumer Brands\\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide laundry detergent and Bounty paper towels among other well known consumer brands, has one thing in common with 3M: the unique ability to produce recurring cash flows from their large number of brands. No matter what cycle the economy is entering, companies like P&G will continue to sell toothpaste and detergent and generate cash for its investors. The world’s largest consumer product company is also one of the largest dividend payers in the sector.\\nThe maker of Dawn dish soap and Pampers has hiked its dividend for 62 consecutive years. Over the past 128 years it has never stopped paying dividends, making money during recessions, wars and droughts. With a current dividend yield of 2.98%, P&G stock pays about $0.72 a share each quarter. This remarkable history of payouts makes this consumer stock a dependable source of passive income for retirement portfolios.\\nThe shares closed down 0.3% at $104.66 yesterday, but they've risen almost 34% in the last 12 months, 28% over the past 5 years. Consumer staple stocks like P&G may not always produce the explosive gains seen in some of the growth stocks, but keeping them in your cash-generating portfolio eliminates the need to worry about the daily market volatility. Once you buy them, you don’t sell them, but sit back and watch them earn regular dividend income.\\nProcter & Gamble Weekly Chart\\nBottom Line\\nIt’s not hard to generate a steady stream of passive income in your retirement if you start saving early and use a portion of these savings to buy dependable income stocks, such as 3M and P&G. Researchers at the Stanford Center on Longevity project conclude that, in order to retire at age 65 and maintain your standard of living, you need to put 10%-17% of your current income into a retirement account. And that’s if you start saving as early as age 25. As the years tick by and you keep re-investing dividends back into your income portfolio, you’ll realize how quickly your nest egg grows, generating sizeable monthly cash flows for you. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) and International Business Machines (NYSE:NYSE:IBM), the US's two centenarian giants, founded in 1892 and 1911 respectively, are each in the middle of a long and painful turnaround.\\nThe challenges they both face, though unique to each, are complex, with no immediate reversal in sight. For contrarian investors, buying these two stocks now may morph into a canny, profitable bet if either of these once-great, multinational behemoths can successfully restructure their businesses and return to sustainable profitability.\\nThere's a long road ahead for each company and no guarantee that they'll ultimately succeed. Is either stock worth adding to your portfolio? And is one any better than the other?\\nGeneral Electric\\nBoston-based GE, the 125-year-old industrial conglomerate that produces light bulbs, jet engines and gas turbines among other things, is fighting on many fronts to restore its growth and preserve cash after demand for its key products, such as power plants and locomotives, weakened.\\nGE Weekly 2015-2018\\nIndeed, GE's current cash-crunch is so acute that management was forced to slash the company's dividend by half this past November, only the second time this has happened since the Great Depression. While management works on its turnaround plan, with the goal of trimming its industrial empire and bolstering GE's balance sheet, the investor community remains skeptical.\\nJPMorgan Chase analyst Stephen Tusa, one of GE's most vocal critics, sees more pain ahead for the company and the real possibility of another dividend cut. In one of his recent reports, he outlined a case whereby General Electric will need a minimum $30 billion of capital to improve its credit profile. He says GE should sell its 63% stake in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE) and cut its dividend to achieve a meaningful reduction in debt load.\\nAccording to RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray, GE’s cash position has worsened this year because of a weaker market for its power equipment and the funding of reserves required for its troubled insurance portfolio.\\nThese negative sentiments have weighed on GE shares, sending them tumbling. They lost half of their value during the past year, wiping out about $120 billion from the company's market capitalization.\\nThe biggest challenge for anyone considering future investment in GE is figuring out whether the worst is over for this giant, and if the timing is opportune for a contrarian position. As Warren Buffett has famously said, the best time to be greedy is when others are fearful.\\nInternational Business Machines\\nThis tech giant has been stuck in the mud during the last five years as it struggles to break with its past, at a time when the rapidly changing technology landscape and shifting consumer preferences have rendered many of IBM’s traditional hardware and software products useless.\\nIBM Weekly 2015-2018\\nThe company’s failure to catch up to new technologies has cost Big Blue's loyal investors heavily. At a time when more efficient, leaner and increasingly innovative Silicon Valley firms delivered triple-digit gains, IBM's revenue growth stalled.\\nIBM shares during the past five years lost 30% of their value, prompting the world’s most successful value investor, Warren Buffett, to exit this trade almost completely in the fourth quarter of 2017. His firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), had plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011, betting on its turnaround. This past May, Buffett revealed that he'd subsequently sold his remaining stake in IBM and no longer holds any shares of the stock.\\nTo reverse IBM's sales slide, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is focusing on the latest technologies—such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence—to drive growth. During this transformation, IBM exited some markets, invested in cloud data centers and bought a number of companies to boost sales, bolster technology offerings and add troves of data to help train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Still, those investments have yet to pay off.\\nIn the first quarter, after adjusting for currency fluctuations, revenue was still flat, while margins slipped 0.6 percentage points to 43.2%. Earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said margins would stabilize “immediately” in the first quarter. Growth in the cloud business was 14% in the first quarter, lower than the 2017 average of 24%, raising doubts about IBM’s hybrid cloud strategy.\\n\\nWhich Stock Is the Better Bet?\\nFor contrarians, both GE and IBM offer an interesting, albeit different risk-reward proposition.\\nThe biggest threat for GE stock is the possibility of an additional dividend cut, something management isn’t ruling out. Should this happen, it’s a much better strategy to remain on the sidelines and let things play out.\\nIf during the remaining portion of the year the company is successful at generating enough cash through its asset sales and restructuring, it will be a very positive signal, suggesting this stock has bottomed out and is likely headed back up.\\nIBM, on the other hand, already has all it takes to turn things around and withstand market volatility. Though it's certainly not going to be the company it once was back in the 80s and early 90s, it’s still on the right track. Even more heartening, its management has already figured out where it has to go.\\nI’m very bullish on IBM's transition to the cloud and artificial intelligence businesses. Those changes could propel the stock going forward.\\nWith its price-to-earning multiple of 23.82, IBM is significantly cheaper than some of its cloud computing peers (think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for example), making it one of the best turnaround bets in the technology space. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nSuddenly there seems to be bad news from every sector of the market. While technology stocks continued to slide, oil producers finished the past week with their share prices collapsing. It could be we\\'re seeing the wind-down of one of the longest bull runs in US history.\\nWith about $3 trillion of US stock valuation wiped out since the September peak, investors have no clue how 2019 might be shaping up. Though we\\'ve just seen above-trend growth, tax cuts, record stock buybacks and still strong profits, the macro environment is worsening, all of which is producing a serious level of uncertainty for investors.\\nAnd unless there\\'s a quick resolution of the US-China trade war and some signs that inflationary pressures are abating, equity markets are likely to trade lower. During the coming week, investors will receive additional clues about the health of US retailers when reports of Black Friday sales are released.\\nWith oil prices continuing to plunge, there could also be another bout of selling pressures in some of the top oil producers. Here are 3 stocks worth keeping an eye on during the coming week\\'s trade:\\n1. Amazon\\nAMZN Weekly\\nThe world’s largest e-tailer, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), is well positioned to benefit from this year’s Black Friday shopping mania. The National Retail Federation predicts some 164 million Americans will shop during the five-day Thanksgiving break which runs from Thursday through Monday.\\nAccording to NRF estimates, online and in-store sales in November and December are expected to increase as much as 4.8% to $720.89 billion, compared to the same period in 2017. Though that\\'s less than last year’s 5.3% gain, it\\'s still well ahead of the 3.9% average increase over the past five years.\\nThe early numbers suggest that American shoppers remain willing to spend and the equity market negativity hasn’t yet gripped consumers. \"This Black Friday is already on pace to surpass Black Friday last year in terms of items ordered,” according to a statement from Amazon. “In just the first nine hours of Black Friday, Amazon customers have ordered more than 1 million toys and more than 700,000 fashion items.\"\\n2. Walmart\\nWMT Weekly \\nThe world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), is another stock to keep an eye on for clues about US consumers and the health of the retail sector as we approach the major holiday shopping season. Robust sales for the week of Black Friday will confirm that spending remains strong. That in turn will be reflected in the big-box retailer’s fourth quarter earnings report which is expected to occur in mid-February 2019.\\nWalmart shares have outperformed the S&P 500 during the past three months, a result of the company’s safe haven status during times of distress. The biggest challenge for Walmart is to continue improving its online sales as a way to grab a bigger share of growing number of shoppers who don’t want to set foot in stores.\\nIn the latest quarter reported, numbers showed that Walmart\\'s online strategy is winning: e-tail sales rose 43% over the same quarter a year earlier. Investors certainly don’t want to see any slowdown on this key metric during the holiday season. This would create doubts about Walmart’s growth prospects in the US and cast a shadow on the company’s ability to manage its massive investment in Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart.\\n3. ExxonMobil\\nXOM Weekly\\nFollowing a sharp plunge in oil prices this past month, oil production majors have been under pressure. On Friday, West Texas Intermediate futures fell more than 6% to $51.03 per barrel, reaching their lowest level of the year.\\nAfter falling more than 4% in the past week,The largest US producer, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) may see further weakness in its share price, which fell more than 4% during the past week. If oil prices continue their downward spiral, it will undoubtedly weigh on shares of all oil producers.\\nAhead of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires which starts on November 30, investors are unlikely to get any clarity on the direction of the oil markets before the G20 summit in Buenos Aires starting Nov. 30 where the key decision makers in the oil markets are set to gather on the sidelines. Additional clarity could come a week later, on December 6, when OPEC and non-OPEC producers gather in Vienna. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nUber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) produced quite a few winners yesterday after raising $8.1 billion in the biggest initial public offering of 2019. Some of Uber’s top employees, Silicon Valley investors, and SoftBank—its largest shareholder—are among those who will be busy booking big gains on their investments.\\nBut the question that’s most relevant now is whether Uber stock is worth buying after its debut today. As much as we love Uber’s hassle-free rides and the technology that makes them possible, we don’t recommend buying its stock, at least not in the first six months.\\nThis is not to downplay the potential of Uber business and the magnitude of disruption it caused in the transportation sector. 10-year-old Uber is the world’s biggest ride-hailing company, commanding more than 65% of market share in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, according to the company’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.\\nBut with this dominant market position, it’s not clear how soon Uber will be able to turn this massive enterprise profitable. The financial numbers that Uber shared with investors before the IPO showed growth in its core ride-hailing service is decelerating.\\nMounting Losses, Decelerating Growth\\nAfter growing 95% in 2017 from the previous year, the revenue growth from this segment dropped sharply to 33% last year. Uber lost $3.04 billion on an operating basis in 2018 on revenue of $11.3 billion, bringing total operating losses over the past three years to more than $10 billion.\\nUber earnings Q4 2018\\nThese numbers are ugly, and that’s why Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi doesn’t want investors to focus on them. Instead, he wants them to value the strength of the company’s evolving “platform,” that he says will one day create the largest modern transportation ecosystem, including its ride-hailing service, its fast-growing food-delivery business, Uber Eats, electric scooters, freight delivery, driverless vehicles and even flying cars.\\n“Our continued success will come from stellar execution and the strength of the platform we have worked so hard to build,” Khosrowshahi told investors in his letter, attached with the filing.\\nThese ambitions look impressive and Uber may reward its investors in the long-run, but its stock looks expensive to us with its IPO being priced at the mid of Uber\\'s proposed price range of $44 to $50 per share. That means its stock would trade at a premium as high as 6-times the company\\'s 2019 sales. We don’t find this valuation tempting for investors in the secondary market, especially when the risk of immediate sell-off is high.\\nThe performance of Uber’s biggest rival, Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), which went public, is a good indicator of what lies ahead for Uber stock. After soaring on its debut on March 29, Lyft has since shed more than 25% of its value.\\nEven if we’re willing to ignore the risks to Uber business, buying shares in the secondary market soon after an IPO has rarely been a profitable bet. \"IPOs can be attractive investments if you can get an allocation, but much less so if you\\'re buying in the secondary market.\" UBS\\' head of asset allocation Jason Draho said in a note last month.\\nOver 60% of more than 7,000 IPOs from 1975 to 2011 had negative absolute returns five years following their first day of trading and only a handful produced extremely positive returns, Draho wrote using data from University of Florida professor Jay Ritter.\\nBottom Line\\nUber’s IPO offers a good opportunity to own a piece of a company at the centre of the transportation revolution, but we don\\'t believe buying its stock soon after it begins trading is a good idea. Better to wait at least six months to see how the stock performs and what the company’s quarterly earnings disclose. The chances are that you’ll get a better pricing after all the hype is over. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOn the heels of this Monday\\'s massive upside surprise on its Q4 2017 earnings report, where Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) showed eye-popping subscriber growth, most analysts are recommending just one thing when it comes to the company\\'s stock: keep buying.\\nNFLX Weekly\\nBut with shares trading at $261.30 as of yesterday\\'s close, up 14.8% since the start of the trading week, perhaps some holders of Netflix stock are asking themselves whether now might not be the right time to take some profit. After all, what are the odds that the company will continue to surprise so extraordinarily in coming quarters?\\nConsider this: there’s a very strong bullish case backing up analysts\\' buy calls. Netflix simply crushed expectations earlier this week after this largest online entertainment network reported its best year of subscription growth so far, adding 24 million customers in 2017.\\nFor the final three months of the fiscal year, Netflix added 8.3 million subscribers compared with expectations for 6.4 million. That huge jump brought its global viewers to 117.6 million.\\nThese robust additions boosted fourth-quarter sales to $3.39 billion, while earnings almost tripled to $0.41 a share from the same period a year ago.\\nThis is an incredible growth story for the video streaming company, at a time when traditional media giants are struggling to keep their viewership intact and going through a massive shakeup.\\nFor investors, Netflix has proven to be a great investment. After surging 55% in 2017, shares are up more than 25% in the first three weeks of this year. The stock is the top performer among the FANGs, the acronym used for high performing, mega-cap technology stocks, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\\nWhat’s Next for Netflix?\\nOne thing investors must understand is that you shouldn\\'t take a short-term approach when investing in an entertainment company.\\nThe biggest factor that will keep subscribers loyal to Netflix is the quality and uniqueness of its content. And that means a lot of cash burn for development and a long horizon before seeing Netflix achieve meaningful profitability.\\nReed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of the company, understands this very well. He plans to spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and another $2 billion on marketing Netflix content. The company also intends to increase its non-English programming, with productions in 30 local languages in 2018.\\nThis huge undertaking will force Netflix to borrow heavily which will compromise earnings growth. Netflix will burn about $4 billion in cash this year and add more to its debt load, which currently stands at $6.5 billion.\\nPlus, the success of Netflix has its problems, too. Other media giants with deep pockets are getting ready to challenge the company\\'s dominance.\\nIn October, Disney (NYSE:DIS) said it plans to launch a streaming video service to rival Netflix in late 2019 with thousands of hours of movies and television content. Disney intends to price this extremely robust service \"substantially below\" the monthly rates Netflix charges, according to Disney\\'s Chief Executive Bob Iger.\\nNetflix last year increased the monthly subscription fee for its most popular plan by $1 to $10.99 a month. Netflix raised cost of its premium plan by $2 to $13.99. It didn’t increase its $7.99 monthly price for the basic one-screen, standard definition-video plan.\\nIs There More Juice Left to Squeeze?\\nDuring the past five years, Netflix investors benefited from a remarkable run. Netflix stock surged more than 900%, producing more than double the gains generated by Facebook and Amazon shares during the same period.\\nNevertheless, I don’t see that rally sputtering anytime soon. Customer stickiness to Netflix service in the U.S. market even after its October price increase shows that the company can significantly improve its bottom line by raising rates going forward.\\nAnd the picture on the international front is even more encouraging. Netflix expects the bulk of future growth in subscriptions to come from global markets—about 77% of the total 6.35 million customers the company expects to sign up in the first quarter.\\nWith a trailing price-to-earning multiple of 209, and shares pushing toward $270, Netflix stock looks very expensive. But if you just focus on the very rich PE multiple, you’re likely to miss the bigger picture. Which is Netflix inherent ability to become a global media giant.\\nI will hold on to Netflix stock despite the temptation to book some profit at these levels. As far as I can tell, the party has just begun! \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOne of America’s most trusted brands — Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) — has been on a downward slide for several years. Shares of the second biggest automaker have consistently produced negative returns over the past five years, missing out on the strong rally in equity markets that sent shares of many consumer stocks soaring.\\nThe stock was trading at $8.78 per share at Friday's close, down almost 21% from $10.86 a year ago. However, one result of this extended bearish spell, and something that stands out about Ford, is its highly attractive dividend yield, which is now close to 7%. To put this into context, compare it with the S&P 500’s average yield of 1.93%. Ford Weekly Chart\\nIs the dividend safe though? Generally, when a company offers a return higher than the market average, it’s taken as a sign of danger. Investors seek a discount to own a stock which is considered more risky. So, does investing in Ford's shares make sense for investors seeking stable dividend income?\\nMajor Turnaround in Progress\\nIt’s been a tough road for Ford. After many years of rising sales, helped by the robust global economy and consumer demand, the car-maker is now facing powerful headwinds: it's undertaking an $11 billion restructuring, after its net income fell by more than half last year as demand for its sedan cars slowed. The turnaround will involve canning thousands of salaried jobs, closing factories overseas, and building capacities to manufacture electric and driverless cars.\\nThe company is exiting from smaller car markets and focusing on SUVs and trucks in the U.S., while accelerating its efforts to quickly enter the electric and self-driving vehicle markets. Last month, it announced it will spend $900 million to build electric and driverless cars at its Flat Rock plant south of Detroit.\\nAs Ford undertakes this massive restructuring exercise to improve profitability and get ready for this new era, investors haven’t shown much faith. The stock has traded below $10 a share since the past summer amid concerns about the sustainability of its generous $0.15-a-share quarterly dividend.\\nAnalysts have built in a potential scenario where Ford's credit-rating could be downgraded soon, and its dividends slashed, if the company’s turnaround plan fails to produce results. The automaker’s reluctance to offer guidance  for 2019 is further fueling these fears.\\n“There is certainly significant value buried in Ford shares, though we are in no rush to buy them with market uncertainty still high (evidenced by management’s reluctance to provide specific guidance) and heavy lifting still required to remove barriers to better performance,” Bank of Montreal analyst, Richard Carlson, said after the company’s Q1 earnings report at the end of last month.\\n“We remain cautious on the shares, as we believe new money going into auto today should be steered towards companies that already have earnings momentum.”\\nDespite Ford’s serious attempt to fight the changing consumer trends and the technology, it’s becoming tough to get excited about its high dividend yield. We believe the company's strategy to fund its transformation into a modern automaker through selling SUVs and big trucks is a risky one.\\nConsumers will quickly shun these high-priced vehicles if the economy turns sour, or the gas prices at the pump continue to soar. A similar combination forced Ford to eliminate its dividend in 2006, which it resumed in 2012 after it emerged as the only Detroit automaker to make it through the global recession without resorting to a government-backed bankruptcy.\\nAnother reason that makes traditional car-makers a less attractive investment option, in our view, is a growing consumer trend where ride-sharing is becoming a new norm, which eliminates much of the need to own a car.\\nThe market valued Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), the second-largest ride-hailing service in the U.S., not far behind Ford in last week’s IPO. Investors' enthusiasm about Lyft, which doesn’t own massive car manufacturing plants, is a big indicator where the future lies.\\nBottom Line\\nIt’s hard to see growth returning to Ford anytime soon. The auto industry is going through major changes which will continue to put pressure on Ford’s earnings, free cash flows and its share price. For long-term income investors, it’s better to wait on the sidelines and monitor how its turnaround is shaping up. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nInvestor focus is shifting back to macro themes now that the Q2 2018 earnings season is drawing to a close. And right now, perhaps the biggest concern for investors continues to be the still escalating US-China trade war.\\nAccording to a Bloomberg report late last week, US President Donald Trump told aides he is ready to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends next week. Washington is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for US companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $375 billion trade gap.\\nThe world’s two largest economies have already applied tariffs to $50 billion of each other’s goods in a tit-for-tat trade war. Talks aimed at easing tensions ended last week without major breakthroughs.\\nAAPL Weekly\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped after the Bloomberg headline. If President Trump actually follows through on this previously threatened move, we might see some weakness in blue chip stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with 21% of its sales coming from Greater China; as well, a substantial amount of the final assembly of iPhones takes place in China. An estimated $15.7 billion of the US-China merchandise trade deficit last year came from iPhones, according to a Reuters analysis in January.\\nThe ongoing trade war has so far failed to cause the remarkable rally in US technology stocks to sputter. Apple, which became the first company in history to cross the trillion dollar market cap benchmark, has surged 35% this year on the back of strong earnings growth and a bullish forecast for the remainder if 2018.\\nChinese Stocks Biggest Trade War Victims So Far\\nUndoubtedly, the most significant casualty of the US-China trade war thus far has been Chinese stocks and indices. The Shanghai Composite, for example, is already among the worst performing global indices, as concerns over trade, slowing growth at home and monetary tightening sap consumer confidence in the world’s second-largest economy.\\nTencent Weekly\\nThe coming week could bring additional weakness for some of the biggest Chinese tech stocks, including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), the China-based internet services and advertising company, which dropped 8% since August 30 after Beijing intensified a crackdown on online gaming. citing rising levels of myopia, thereby increasing regulatory bottlenecks for companies in the world's biggest gaming market.\\nBeyond trade wars, there is one earnings report scheduled for later this coming week which might be important for investors with an interest in chipmakers.\\nAVGO Weekly\\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on Thursday September 6 after the market close, has been under selling pressure since it announced in early July that it planned to buy New York-based software producer CA (NASDAQ:CA) for about $19 billion in cash. Investors didn’t like the deal, sending Broadcom shares lower by 13% since then.\\nFor some analysts, the purchase of CA—which makes software for large, mainframe computers—doesn't make sense and appears not to afford any synergies for Broadcom. During its upcoming earnings call, Broadcom management might try to convince investors one more time of the potential inherent in the CA deal and its future growth potential.\\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10.62, Broadcom shares, which closed at $219.03 on Friday, look cheap after its recent pullback. The stock pays an annual dividend of $7 for a 3.23% yield. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThere's been a stark mismatch between the strong rally in semiconductor stocks and overall market conditions this year. Defying concerns about surging inventory levels and the U.S.-China trade war, chip stocks have continued their steady upward progress. At least, until recently.\\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the benchmark for the industry, has gained 32% this year, even after accounting for 3.8% decline during the past five trading days. That surge is still about double the expansion in the S&P 500 Index (+16%)  during the same period.\\nPhiladelphia Semiconductor Index price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that period of strength is about to come to an end, in our view, given the context of a still-weak demand outlook for companies which make chips for computers, cell phones, the gaming industry, and data centres.\\nThe shares of Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), that were up more than 60% until mid-September, have tumbled 14% in the past five trading days, showing the nervousness among investors.\\nMicron Technology price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther evidence of this weakness came from an industry leader Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) last month when the company reiterated a muted demand forecast for the rest of the fiscal year.\\n“We believe demand has bottomed out but will continue to remain at these levels due to the current uncertain environment,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in a statement, dimming hopes for a sharp recovery in the second-half — which were based on an optimistic scenario that many bulls have built in their valuations, focused on 2020 when 5G phone roll-out is expected to gain pace and fuel chip sales.\\nEconomic Woes\\nBroadcom’s warning is very important for investors because the San Jose, California-based company has one of the most expansive product lines in the industry. The chipmaker sells components to the world’s largest cell phone makers, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). It’s also one of the major suppliers of networking components used by large data center operators.\\nOne big uncertainty for chip companies comes from the overall outlook of the global economy as the demand for chips is closely tied with global growth. Recent economic data suggests that the slowdown in the U.S. manufacturing sector is deepening, meaning it will be tough for the U.S. and the global economy to avoid a recession. If that happens the rally in chip stocks could unravel quickly.\\nTotal semiconductor sales declined about 15% on a year-over-year basis in July, according to reports from industry analysts, who cited data from the Semiconductor Industry Association. That followed a drop of 17% in June, and May’s 15% decline.\\nDavid Wong, a Nomura Instinet analyst, citing the July data, questioned those who are seeing a quick recovery in demand.\\n“We remain deep in a semiconductor downturn,” wrote Wong, in a note to clients last month. The report “is in line with the muted forward guidance given over the last six weeks by several chip companies that we consider to be broad indicators for many chip end markets.”\\nBottom Line\\nInvesting in chip stocks just doesn’t make sense at the moment, especially when threats to their growth haven’t fully subsided yet. Any negative development on the U.S.-China trade negotiations, more bad news on the Chinese economic front, and a possible slowdown in U.S. expansion are just some of the headwinds that make avoiding semiconductor stocks in general the wisest course. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nInvestor risk appetite has returned. Last week, high-growth technology stocks soared, helping to drive major U.S. indices higher. Tech has been the best performing S&P 500 sector so far this year.\\nThis renewed optimism is being driven by hopes that global central banks are ready to help the markets offset any negative impact coming from a slowing global economy. As well, investors continued to buy shares of some the largest tech companies during the past week even as economic data pointed to a global economy hitting a rough patch. In the U.S., a report released in early March showed manufacturing output shrank for a second straight month in February, followed by a weak reading on Chinese industrial output last week.\\nBeyond these macro themes, some large cap stocks continued to dominate the headlines. There is a good possibility that these big players will again set the tone for the market in the coming week. Below are the three stocks we're keeping an eye on:\\n1. Boeing\\nThis next week might bring some clarity on the future of Boeing’s (NYSE:BA) beaten-down stock after regulators around the world grounded the company’s promising 737 MAX 8 airliner, after the jets were involved in two deadly crashes during the past five months.\\nBA Weekly TTM\\nShares of Boeing, which were up 37% this year until last Sunday’s Ethiopian Airline crash, gave back nearly 15% of their value during the course of last week, on concerns that it may take years for Boeing to recover from this disaster. Several airline operators around the world have indicated that they will re-consider their Boeing orders.\\nAnalysts are outlining both best and worst-case scenarios for the company which was in the middle of a strong expansion before the last week’s fatal crash derailed it. One potential best case scenario is that the company quickly fixes what's reported to be a software problem and the U.S. allows its 737 MAX jets back in the air, which would then be followed by other regulators.\\n“We believe if the two crashes are found to be of a similar cause that is a better outcome for Boeing than if not,” Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell said in a report cited by Bloomberg. “We believe an additional discovery would likely entail a longer grounding of the aircraft.”\\nAccording to Mitchell's estimates, assuming the company continues MAX jet production, but customers don't take deliveries, Boeing’s monthly cash flow could be hurt by about $1.5 billion to $2 billion, including any potential airline penalty payments.\\n2. Facebook\\nIt appears that Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Mark Zuckerberg, along with other social media executives, could find themselves back in damage control mode this coming week, after a mass shooter, in New Zealand killed 50 people in an attack on two mosques during Friday services, which he was able to live stream on social media. His actions prompted new calls for stricter control over all such platforms.\\nThe video of the killings, which was first uploaded to the alleged shooter’s Facebook account, was readily accessible during and after the attack, along with the suspect’s hate-filled manifesto.\\nFB Weekly TTM\\nFacebook shares fell more than 2% on Friday to $165.98 after posting a strong rally in 2019 on signs that the company’s ad revenue had remained unaffected by the public uproar against the biggest social media platform. But the latest events in New Zealand will continue pressuring social media companies to stop the use of their networks from spreading hate and violence.\\nIndeed, Mark Zuckerberg seems busy overhauling his company from both a policy standpoint, but he may need to do so from an executive perspective as well. Last week, his most senior executive, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox announced that he is leaving the social media giant as part of Facebook’s move to integrate its apps more tightly and use more encryption, a big shift from the company’s current focus on public sharing.\\nAmid these big changes and what appears to be never-ending firefighting, we think the risks to the rally of Facebook shares are once again rising. It will be critical to see if the selling pressure on the stock intensifies.\\n3. Tesla\\nThere's been no let up in the most recent Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) sell-off, even after the electric carmaker unveiled its Model Y crossover on Friday. Investors still sent the company's shares tumbling more than 5% to $275.43, exhibiting concerns over the automaker’s tight cash situation, something we highlighted last week.\\nTSLA Weekly TTM\\nOne possible explanation for this worst post-launch performance of Tesla shares: investors may not have liked CEO Elon Musk’s plan to collect $2,500 deposits for the crossover, which he plans to start delivering in the next 18 months. The deposit amount is more than double than what he collected for the Model 3 sedan.\\nThe market is taking that as a signal of a potential cash crunch, which Musk is trying to overcome as demand for cars slows and after the company cleared a hefty bond payment in cash early this month. Our view on Tesla stock remains the same: it continues to be a highly risky bet.\\nWith the company’s small cash reserves, its marketing strategy in trouble, and its CEO in what looks like a constant battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we don’t see Tesla shares stabilizing anytime soon. Indeed, in the next week the stock might see additional losses. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nReports Q4 2019 results on Tuesday, Feb. 19, before the market opens\\nRevenue expectation: $138.66 billion\\nEPS expectation: $1.33\\n\\nWhen the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer reports fourth-quarter earnings next week, it will need to provide investors with a compelling reason to get bullish about its shares. One of the biggest worries Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investors continue to focus on is how the retailer will keep improving its margins when costs are escalating.\\nWMT Weekly\\nDuring Q3, comparable sales for Walmart stores in the U.S—a key performance barometer—rose 3.4%, beating analysts’ estimates. That beat, however, failed to produce a rally in its stock since costs also escalated. Along with controlling costs, Walmart also needs to show that its e-commerce strategy is well on track to counter online competitors, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well as digital upstarts that are attracting millennial shoppers in droves.\\nGiven these challenges, in our view, Walmart’s quarterly report card has been impressive. A turnaround in same-store sales, which started in the third-quarter of fiscal 2015, has gained pace in the company’s fiscal 2019. As of its most recent report on Nov. 15, 2018, comparable store sales rose for 16 consecutive quarters. If that U.S. growth momentum continues, we see good reasons to believe that Walmart is in a solid position to continue to repeat that performance.\\nThis growth cycle has been fueled by a number of pivotal efforts: the company’s massive investments in its online channels, its focus on cleaner and better-stocked stores and improvement in its grocery offerings. Walmart’s e-commerce business has expanded by around 40% in the past two earnings reports, an impressive reading on a metric that's critical for the company’s long-term success.\\nWe see this retail giant continuing to gain market share in these categories going forward, while keeping a tight lid on costs. No other retailer commands the bargaining power that Walmart enjoys, enabling it to squeeze suppliers for lower prices.\\nShort-Term Headwinds\\nThat said, we're also cognizant of some short-term headwinds that could keep its share price under pressure. India’s recent regulatory moves to support small merchants against e-commerce giants ahead of the general election in the spring has created some uncertainty for Walmart’s global expansion.\\nThe new rules may hurt both Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon’s local business as the Indian market becomes more complicated for these giant retailers. Other factors that could pressure Walmart’s stock include the ongoing U.S.-China trade battles and any uncertainty over the general direction of the markets and the economy.\\nStill, despite these challenges, we like Walmart stock for long-term investors and see the retailer as a good candidate for any defensive portfolio, especially when its earnings momentum remains strong and its online presence continues expanding.\\nBottom Line\\nSome investors might consider Walmart stock, which closed yesterday at $96.20, as expensive given its forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 20. But that concern ignores the fact the retailer isn’t the same company it was five years ago.\\nWith current e-commerce momentum and its strong, core brick-and-mortar operations, we believe if there's any post earnings sell-off, it's a good entry point for long-term investors. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAs 2019 begins, it looks as if markets are picking up where they left off at the end of last year, when volatility reigned and high-flying growth stocks started losing their luster. We believe volatility will continue and growth stocks will remain under pressure on increasing concerns the decade-long US economic expansion could be coming to an end.\\nDuring times of market gyrations and increasing economic uncertainty, having a few income stocks in one's portfolio is a good defense. In fact, in 2018 defensive stocks outperformed the broader market. In this space, we strongly favor the global healthcare provider Merck (NYSE:MRK) for two reasons—its roster of top selling meds and the company's dependable dividend.\\n1. Strong Growth Momentum; Powerhouse Drugs\\nMRK Weekly\\nOver the past three years, Merck has consistently exceeded analysts expectations on earnings. This impressive winning streak powered its shares higher. Indeed, for 2018 it was the best performer among the 30 mega cap companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 30% for the year.\\nWe don’t expect that pace of growth to slow anytime soon either. Merck's cancer immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, continues to capture market share. In the first nine of months of 2018, Keytruda sales doubled, reaching a whopping $5 billion. The drug has become a core component of Merck’s growth, particularly in the large and lucrative area of lung cancer.\\nEarlier this year the drug showed what medical experts called practice-changing results when combined with chemotherapy. As well, just last month, Keytruda gained EU approval for use on adults who've undergone surgery to remove melanomas. According to Merck, it's the first approval for the drug as an auxiliary treatment in the European Union.\\nSome analysts expect the majority of previously untreated patients will start taking the drug as well. According to EvaluatePharma projections, it could bring in $12.69 billion in annual sales by 2024. Helped by Keytruda’s remarkable success, Merck plans to invest $16 billion on new capital projects through 2022, a 33% surge over what the company announced it would spend in early 2018.\\nWhile Merck’s cancer treatment is grabbing much of the attention, the company’s other drugs are also performing well. HPV vaccine Gardasil’s sales were up 55% in the third-quarter from the year ago period, while diabetes medications Januvia and Janumet brought in $1.49 billion in sales during the same period.\\n2. Reliable Payouts\\nOne of the primary reasons to bet on a dividend paying stock is for its benefits during market highs and lows. Which means the focus should be on the company's history of reliably paying dividends.\\nWith its forward dividend yield of about 3%, Merck has made returning capital to investors a top priority. Since at least 1970, the company has never missed a quarterly payout. Merck's dividend has grown at an annualized rate of 5.5% since 2010—beating the rate of inflation. After delivering a 15% hike in October, Merck now pays $0.55 a share every three months.\\nThe company has also been returning capital to stockholders in recent years via share buybacks, further boosting its total yield. In October, the company announced that it plans to buy back an additional $10 billion worth of outstanding shares.\\nAny future dividend growth will depend on both earnings and the company's payout ratio. Merck's current payout ratio is 66%, suggesting it's in a comfortable position to continue the current dividend growth strategy.\\nBottom Line\\nIf you’re looking to play it safe in 2019, Merck is worth considering. At its current $75.43 share price, with a dividend yield that's a bit higher than the pharmaceutical industry average, it's a good shelter for conservative, long-term investors. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been on the hunt for the next big thing to create excitement—and of course drive additional growth—for investors. Two recent developments, one still only a rumor, could be just the fuel the company, and its rangebound stock, need.\\nKO Weekly\\nShares of a Canadian marijuana producer, Aurora Cannabis (OTC:ACBFF), jumped 17% on September 17 after Bloomberg reported that Coke was in talks with Aurora to explore the possibility of creating cannabis-infused drinks. Though both companies neither confirmed nor denied the news, their statements left investors guessing...and intrigued.\\nCoke said it is \"closely watching\" the growth of CBD, a non-psychoactive component in marijuana, as an ingredient in what it called functional wellness beverages. \"The space is evolving quickly,\" Coke further noted, though, \"no decisions have been made at this time.\" CBD, which does not produce a high for the user, has been used for medical purposes, including easing inflammation, pain and nausea.\\nPrior to jolting the highly speculative marijuana market, Coke created ripples in the fiercely competitive coffee market when it announced last month that it was acquiring UK-based global coffee chain Costa for $5.1 billion. This was Coke\\'s biggest acquisition in eight years. The deal sent shares of Costa\\'s parent company Whitbread PLC (LON:WTB) soaring. The stock gained 19% on August 31, the biggest jump in two decades.\\nMid-Turnaround, Brand Headwinds Still Keeping Stock Rangebound\\nDespite these headline-grabbing developments during the past few weeks, Coke shares continue to trade within a range. The stock closed at $46.58 on Friday, slowly moving towards the 52-week high of $48.62 hit early this year. The biggest reason for this lackluster performance is that the world’s largest beverage company is still in the middle of a turnaround effort, as customers are altering their food and beverage choices.\\nConsumers are shunning surgery sodas, shifting to healthier drinks. That headwind is so strong that it’s rattling many established brands and slowing sales growth. Over the past few years, Coke has been working to reduce the amount of sugar in its flagship drinks, while adding a variety of low- and no-sugar alternatives, including soy-based beverages, teas, waters and juices, as a way to revive sales that have been declining since 2012.\\nSince James Quincey took over as chief executive officer in May 2017, he\\'s been cutting costs and restructuring the company’s beverage offerings. His campaign appears to be taking shape, and paying off. In the company\\'s second quarter earnings report, Coke\\'s sales and profit beat analyst estimates, as the rebranding of Diet Coke and a double-digit jump in Coca-Cola Zero sales boosted results. “We’re winning in the marketplace so far this year and our strategy’s on track,” Quincey said on a call with analysts after the earnings release in late July.\\nBottom Line\\nDespite its current challenges, Atlanta-based Coke remains a solid dividend stock for long-term investors. The company has increased its dividend for 56 years in a row. That\\'s more than enough confirmation of the strength of the 21 brands it owns which generate $1 billion or more in annual sales, (out of a staggering 500 brands globally).\\nTrading at $46.49 a share as of Friday\\'s close, with an annual dividend yield of 3.39%, now is a good time to bet on Coke\\'s turnaround. This is especially salient after its Costa deal, which opens another door for the company’s long-term growth in the most robust category of non-alcoholic beverages. With its 3,800 stores, Costa provides Coke a global retail presence and a hedge against slowing soda sales. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nInvesting in marijuana stocks has been one of the most popular trades over the past three years. Some pot producers have delivered astonishing returns on speculations that the companies that produce the commodity will hit the jackpot once Canada legalizes cannabis for recreational use.\\nThat\\'s set to happen next week, so the wait is almost over. Canada will become the first industrialized nation where one can buy and consume weed legally. For top marijuana producers, however, the real battle has just begun.\\nThe initial speculative frenzy that pushed marijuana stock prices to the sky is over. Now, their future success will be determined by their ability to scale production and market their products to win the biggest share.\\nIf you are planning to invest in this new industry, our advice is to stick with the largest producers who have the financial muscle and backing of large investors to succeed. We believe that Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE:CGC, TO:WEED) and Aurora Cannabis Inc (OTC:ACBFF, TO:ACB) are two stocks that have what it takes to be long-term winners in this game.\\n1. Canopy Growth Corp\\nCanopy Growth Corp is ideally positioned to take advantage of the anticipated demand boom from recreational pot users. What makes Canopy different from other producers is its market size, capacity to ramp up production, the diversification of its product offerings, and its international reach.\\nCanopy currently operates weed growing facilities with over 2.4 million square feet of space. But the producer has been rapidly expanding its operations and will have the potential to manage more than 5 million square feet of production space by next year.\\nWeekly Canopy Chart: 2017-2018\\nIn addition to its scale, what makes Canopy an attractive stock is the backing of one of the largest beer producers, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). In August, Constellation increased its stake in Canopy from 5.5% to a whopping 38%. There is no doubt that bet has worked in Constellation\\'s favor as Canopy is poised to take off.\\nIn an earnings call with analysts last week, Constellation CEO Robert Sands said that the company’s aggressive strategy in the weed market has placed it in the best position to capitalize on what is going to be a market worth “hundreds of billions of dollars” over the next ten years. \"We expect to reap the benefits of our cannabis investment, which we see as being incremental to our core beer, wine and spirits portfolio,\" he added.\\nCanopy is currently trading at $47.860. With the Canadian marijuana market set to take off at any moment, and the strong partnership between Constellation and Canopy, we expect great things are ahead for the stock.\\n2. Aurora Cannabis\\nAs the marijuana market grows, a great way to play the trade is to diversify your investments by buying shares of companies that are strong in both recreational and medical markets. Therefore, Canada-based Aurora Cannabis is an excellent choice since it\\'s emerging as one of the leading suppliers of medical marijuana.\\nThis year, Aurora Cannabis further solidified its position by acquiring two major competitors, MedReleaf and CanniMed. These deals positioned Aurora as the number two player behind Canopy Growth in the Canadian market.\\nIn addition, Aurora is well-positioned globally since countries from the U.K. to Mexico are in the process of approving use of medical marijuana. The company has also recently announced a $290 million deal to buy ICC Labs, which has a 70% market share in Uruguay, where legal recreational sales already exist. In Europe, Aurora Cannabis already has operations in Germany, Italy, and Denmark.\\n5-Hour Aurora Chart: August-October 2018\\nWhile things are already looking good for Aurora, the stock may be about to break higher. The next big trigger for this producer is a potential partnership with a global brand. Its shares have more than doubled since September 17 when Bloomberg reported that Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was in talks with Aurora Cannabis as it explores the possibility of developing drinks infused with CBD – the non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that treats pain but doesn’t get you high. Aurora is currently trading at $10.0460 and as the possibility of a partnership looms, this may be the time to jump in.\\nBottom Line\\nBetween these two stocks we definitely find Aurora attractively priced when compared to Canopy. The company has a much better upside potential if Coco-Cola\\'s interest results in a future deal.\\nInvesting in marijuana stocks is always a risky trade. This is especially true after such a powerful rally in the run-up to Canadian legalization, particularly when these companies have yet to actually produce profit. However, if you\\'re looking to get in on this growing industry, then large producers such as Canopy and Aurora are the safest bets to buy and hold over the medium to long run. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors can barely catch a break from the bad news flow. Last month, it was Walmart (NYSE:WMT) suing the electric car-maker ,blaming its faulty batteries for causing a fire in at least seven of its stores. And who knows what’s in the cards for September.\\nBut amid this never-ending cycle of setbacks, Tesla shares have surged, in a rebound that started in June. Despite the occasional dip, such as yesterday's, when the stock closed down 0.3% at $225.01, shares have gained more than 22% in the past three months at a time when the benchmark S&P 500 saw highly volatile trading and investors shunned growth stocks.\\nTesla price chart\\nAnd yet, Tesla shares are still down more than 30% this year, hurt by a series of missteps and on concerns that the car-maker is finding it hard to grow the order book for its electric cars and balance its accounts.\\nThe recent rally could prove short-lived given the boom-and-bust pattern of Tesla shares, however it shows one positive change: investors are increasingly buying into CEO Elon Musk’s new narrative that emphasizes the expansion of its production capacity and model lineup, rather than the achievement of bottom-line profitability.\\nTesla is now targeting break-even in the current quarter, after the car maker reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss in July. The company is eyeing a return to profitability during the last three months of the year.\\nVolume Growth, Capacity Expansion\\nIn a letter to shareholders in July, Musk emphasised that “continuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation will remain the main focus,” adding that Tesla is working to expand its “manufacturing footprint in new regions, launching new products and continuing to improve the customer experience while generating and using cash sustainably.”\\nWith that rhetoric, investors are luckily seeing some positive developments on the ground that are helping the stock to sustain the momentum. Last week, Tesla won an exemption from a 10% purchase tax on the vehicles it sells in China, despite trade tensions between the country and the U.S.\\nThe exemption, which is aimed at domestic makers of electric vehicles, benefits all Tesla models sold in China. The company currently imports all of the cars it sells in the Asian country, but plans to make the Model 3, its best-selling vehicle, at its new China plant which is likely to start production late this year.\\nIn Europe, demand for the Model 3 sedan has been steady, and should help offset some weakness seen in China, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent note. These positive comments coincide with Moody’s Investors Service’s recent assessment of the company’s credit outlook, stating that it has changed from negative to stable. The reason cited is an improvement in the Model 3 production systems.\\n“The stable outlook anticipates that improving operating efficiencies of the Model 3, growing regulatory credit sales, and an adequate liquidity position will provide a sufficient runway to continue undertaking cost cutting initiatives that will improve profitability in the face of aggressive expansion plans,” Moody’s said in a note on Tesla.\\nWith this positive assessment, however, sales of the company’s older and more profitable vehicles, the Model S and X, continue to be weak, hurting margins and cash generation. In the U.S., growth for these cars has stalled after a strong end to the second quarter, and Tesla would need to see a strong September order flow to hit its aggressive third-quarter guidance, according to Ives.\\nBottom Line\\nDespite some positive news flow in recent weeks, demand for its cars and the company’s ability to make a profit are the two factors which will decide whether Tesla shares are a good long-term investment. If Tesla is able to turn the corner on these fronts quickly without the CEO generating more controversies, it will certainly provide a positive signal for its stock. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nBefore Twitter's second-quarter earnings report, there are clear signs of unease among investors. They aren’t sure whether its shares have more room to run after more than doubling in the past year.\\nTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) reports results before the bell Friday and analysts are predicting a quarterly profit of 16 cents per share, up from 5 cents per share in the year-ago period.\\nRevenue is expected to have risen to $697.85 million from $573.9 million.\\nTwitter (TWTR) 1-Year Chart\\nThe stock is down from a three-year high earlier this month. That caution is a typical problem that investors in high-growth companies face: how to distinguish between the real opportunities and the stocks that already reflect all the good news?\\nTwitter has been the best-performing stock among the high-octane technology names like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). There are expectations the business has finally turned the corner. The company reported its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter of last year and it was also profitable in Q1.\\nThe number of people who use the platform every day has also shown remarkable growth. Twitter's daily active user growth was more than 10% in the first quarter, marking the sixth-consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this key metric.\\nGrowth-Hungry Investors Can Be Satisfied\\nIt’ll be tough, but we think Twitter’s growth momentum will continue well into the remaining part of 2018 and beyond. Twitter’s push to release more video content on its platform has been a real success and it’s attracting lots of advertisers. Video now accounts for more than half of Twitter's ad revenue and was the company's fastest-growing ad format during the last quarter.\\nIn the last quarter, Twitter has signed more than 30 new partnerships -- including deals with Fox Sports, Comcast, Viacom and Disney -- featuring a ton of ESPN programming and a World Cup partnership. Industry insiders believe these deals uniquely positioned Twitter to benefit from the large shift in dollars toward mobile and native advertising.\\nWatch Operating Expenses And Margins\\nOne area of concern is about the company’s ability to keep its costs down at a time when it’s aggressively pushing the video strategy. In 2017, Twitter did a great job containing its spending and operating expenses fell 21%.\\nWe might see some pressure on margins due to rising costs at a time when social media giants are trying to appease regulators by purging their networks of fake accounts, political bots and hate speech. Twitter has suspended more than 70 million fake accounts in May and June. The company later said it’s conducting an audit to ensure that every account created on Twitter has passed a security check to prevent bots from gaining access.\\nEven after gaining more than 100% during the past year, Twitter shares are still only about halfway to their all-time high of $74.73 reached in December 2013. In order to continue this upward move, we think Twitter has to show significant revenue growth.\\nWe think the company is on a right track to increase its number of active users and turn the platform into one that advertisers increasingly value. Any post-earning weakness should be a buying opportunity for those looking for a good entry point. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nCould video-streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) be heading for a fall? It\\'s not unusual for high-flying tech companies to lose their momentum and stop showing the level of growth the markets have already priced in, often resulting in a nasty and unwelcome correction.\\nFacebook, Apple Weekly\\nThe price charts of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), during 2018 provide a good example of this: Both stocks were down between 30%-50% from their mid-year record highs of the past 12 months. The factors that brought these tech giants to their knees were different, but the losses were quick and colossal in both cases.\\nNetflix\\'s fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report in mid-January suggests it may be the next in line to disappoint.\\nNFLX Weekly 2016-2019\\nInvestors love Netflix stock for one primary reason: it continues to show impressive subscriber growth, the bottom-line number most analysts and investors focus on. Netflix shares have rallied 477% in the past five years, a reflection of the explosive demand for its cheap and easy-to-use service that now has 139 million subscribers worldwide.\\nSlowing U.S. Growth, Cash Burn\\nIn the final quarter of last year, Netflix added nearly 9 million new paying subscribers and expects to add another 8.9 million subscribers in the quarter that ends in March. But beneath these forecasts, we see danger lurking: growth is plateauing in the streaming entertainment giant\\'s home market, from which it derives most of its revenue.\\nThe internet giant expects to add 1.6 million new paying customers in the U.S. in Q1, down from 2.3 million it added in the same period a year ago. Investors are willing to ignore that deceleration in growth as long as Netflix shows overall growth and remains a strong brand globally.\\nBut in markets, perception is the reality and it doesn’t take much to change that perception. The company’s latest move to raise its monthly prices for its over 60 million U.S. customers between $1 to $2 a month, also shows that Netflix isn’t betting big on the home front and plans to squeeze more dollars from the existing base.\\nAnother potential red flag is that Netflix is pursuing a risky growth model based on borrowing from credit markets to fund new programming as well as its marketing budget. While reporting its Q4 numbers, Netflix disclosed that it expects to spend about $3 billion more than it takes in during 2019. This would make it the company’s sixth straight year of burning cash.\\nSo far, Netflix debt-fueled growth has paid off. The company is producing highly acclaimed original films and series. According to CNN, Netflix’s \"Roma,” has 10 Academy Award nominations this year and is widely considered the favorite to win the best picture Oscar.\\nNetflix stock, which closed yesterday at $356.87, has rebounded strongly from its December low, surging about 54% since the Christmas Eve slump.\\nBut what if subscriber growth in its most lucrative market continues to slow and the company keeps burning more cash each year to cover the cost of its success? Investors would find it hard to ignore a mix of that sort, and the company\\'s stock price would, sooner or later, reflect that reality.\\nBottom Line\\nHighlighting these risks doesn’t mean that we don’t like Netflix stock. In our view, it\\'s a great success story which has totally re-shaped the media entertainment industry.\\nThe company will likely generate many more blowout quarters on the strength of its content, wide global appeal, and superior technology. However, long-term investors should be ready for short-term corrections when they invest in high growth stocks. After Facebook and Apple, Netflix might be the next to test their nerves. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nAs bond yields continue to rise, investors are once again finding themselves nervous about the future direction of the equities market. That uncertainty was largely responsible for the broad-based sell-off in stocks last week, led by tech shares.\\nA continuous flow of solid economic data has pushed US Treasury yields to multiyear highs, prompting some investors to question the tenacity of a bull run that so far hasn’t shown any sign of peaking. It will also be interesting to see whether bears can cause more damage to high-flying tech names in the coming week, or if bargain hunters start to become active about taking advantage of attractive opportunities that could be developing.\\nIn the short run, the fear of higher interest rates will continue to dominate markets until investor focus shifts to the third-quarter earnings season that’s just round the corner. Here are three stocks we believe could see some price swings in the coming week.\\n1. JPMorgan Chase\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), the largest American investment bank, will be among the first companies to report their third-quarter earnings this coming Friday. Analysts on average expect $2.23 EPS for the period ending September 30, up from $1.76 from the same period a year ago. As well, the consensus expectation is for $27.53B in revenues when the multinational lender reports on October 12, before the market open.\\nJPM Weekly 2015-2018\\nAt a time when the economy is strong and interest rates are on an upward trajectory, bank shares are likely to perform better. Investors will wait to see whether any of these factors are helping the US's largest lenders improve their bottom line. Peer financial companies including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) also report on Friday.\\nIn the previous quarter, JPMorgan was able to beat market expectations since revenue from both fixed-income and equity trading surged. As well, fees from investment banking also topped estimates.\\n2. Tesla\\nElon Musk, the embattled CEO of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is at it again. Even after his recent brush with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) he's not giving his Twitter finger a rest long enough to let shares of his electric car maker trade on their fundamentals. Soon after settling with the SEC regarding his reckless tweet in August about taking the company private, he was back on Twitter this past Friday, now criticizing both the SEC and short sellers (whose expanding positions in Tesla shares have been plaguing his company's stock for some time now).\\nTSLA Daily 2015-2018\\nTesla stock plunged more than 7% on Friday after Musk fired off more than a dozen tweets on the subject over the course of Thursday. He mocked the agency as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” and sarcastically praised it for “doing incredible work.”\\nHis latest tweets may trigger fresh action from the SEC, which is still in the middle of finalizing last week's settlement which bars Musk from serving as chairman of the carmaker for three years. As part of the deal, the company also has to implement procedures and controls to oversee Musk’s communications. Investors should brace for another tumultuous week in Tesla shares.\\n3. Walgreens\\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), the second-largest pharmacy operator in the US will report Q4 earnings on Thursday, October 11 before the market open. Analysts expect an EPS of $1.44 a share in the quarter ending August, up from $1.31 a share in the same period a year ago on revenues of $33.73B.\\nWBA Weekly\\nThe chain is benefiting from its recent acquisition of Rite Aid stores. That deal helped fuel growth in back of store sales at the prescription counter, which account for more than 70% of Walgreens' US drugstore sales.\\nSince the announcement of its third quarter earnings at the end of June, WBA shares are up 18%. At that time, Walgreens also authorized a $10 billion stock buyback. Investors will be especially keen to see an improvement in the drug retailer’s same-store sales which had actually declined in the previous quarter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWhen Warren Buffett, the world’s most successful value investor speaks, other investors listen. This past Saturday, February 24, Buffett's much anticipated, annual letter to the shareholders of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), was released. Here's what he had to say:\\n“In America, equity investors have the wind at their back,” he wrote,with the backdrop of increased volatility and investor nervousness on the future direction of the markets. Buffett’s advice to investors comes during a month when the U.S. equity market experienced its worst single-day plunge in almost seven years. In the letter, he also advised investors to never buy stocks with borrowed money. “There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period,” he said in the letter.\\n\\n“Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.”\\n\\nBut the most important piece of information that investors await is what the Oracle of Omaha is buying and selling. Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), showed that during the fourth quarter, Buffett raised his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake in a big way.\\nBerkshire boosted its Apple position by 23.3%, to 165.3 million shares, suggesting Berkshire Chairman and CEO Warren Buffet does not believe that the so-called supercycle of the iPhone X is losing steam, as has been feared by some analysts. After adding 31.2 million shares in the fourth quarter, Berkshire raised its total position in Apple to about $29 billion at today's market price. The stock closed at $175.50 before the weekend.\\n\\nMajor Bullish Signal for Apple Stock\\nApple is now Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock holding by value, and there's little evidence to suggest that Warren Buffet’s enthusiasm for the tech giant is waning. He told CNBC in August of last year that he has never sold a single share of Apple since buying them.\\nAAPL Weekly 2015-2017\\nThis is not the first time that the billionaire investor has shown his enthusiasm for the stock. Buffett first bought Apple shares in early 2016, when the company was struggling to overcome slowing iPhone demand in China. Loading up on more Apple stock in the fourth quarter means he is still bullish on Apple's future despite some signs of slowing sales.\\nIn an article published on February 5 on this site, I advised readers that Apple stock offers good value to long-term investors. I noted that it was worth taking advantage of the dip that followed the company’s latest earnings report to enter a position. I think Buffett’s fresh buying of Apple stock, at a time when some investors have doubts about the company’s future, is a major bullish signal for Apple. Buffett has only a handful of technology investments—indeed, just two, Apple and IBM (NYSE:IBM).\\nIf you are familiar with Buffett’s strategy, you might have some idea why he likes Apple. Buffett coined the term “economic moat,” to describe the power of companies such as Apple. These companies have a durable competitive advantage; they’re run by an efficient management team, and their stock trades at a reasonable price. Apple’s stock ticks all three boxes.\\nFor some, Apple's reliance on major chip, hardware and software engineering make it a technology company, but I think Apple is a consumer brand. Apple’s brand, its stickiness and customer loyalty, provide a major competitive advantage that's hard to match.\\nBottom Line: The latest price action shows that Apple’s stock is quickly regaining lost ground after some setbacks earlier this month when the world’s largest phone maker said it sold fewer iPhones during the 2017 holiday season than what analysts had expected. The company also missed on Wall Street’s expectations for sales during the upcoming March quarter by several billion dollars. Apple stock, after falling to $150.24 on February 9, has surged higher by about 17% since then.\\nDespite this temporary setback, I don’t think Apple has run out of options for continuing to generate explosive growth, especially when it has $250 billion sitting in cash. I expect additional price gains in the coming months as the company recaptures the market's confidence and sales growth accelerates. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Its shares have soared, bringing the restaurant chain close to the levels they were trading at before the first of several outbreaks of E. coli and norovirus at some of its restaurants in 2015.\\nAfter gaining 64% during the year so far, Chipotle stock was heading toward its August 2015, $758.6 record high, before dropping over the past three sessions, to close yesterday at $688.21. With the stock surge, it appears customers have mostly forgotten about the outbreaks that had such a devastating impact on the Mexican fast-food giant’s customer traffic and revenues in the following quarters.\\nChipotle monthly chart\\nChart powered by TradingView\\nWhen Chipotle releases its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, April 24, investors will seek reassurance that the company’s turnaround plan is well on track and it’s sustaining the uptrend in its comparable sales growth.\\nEncouraging Developments\\nDigging a little deeper into CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround strategy, we see some very encouraging developments that are helping the food-chain at a time when the U.S restaurant industry overall has been struggling to bring diners to their tables.\\nFirst, he is very successfully implementing his digital initiatives and customers are responding to that. In the fourth-quarter, Chipotle showed about 66% growth in its digital sales from a year earlier period, and that accounted for 13% of overall sales during the period.\\nThat company was able to make that meaningful transition to online channels by making some simple in-store changes, such as adding second “make lines” for assembling burritos that were ordered online, and digital pick-up shelves. These smart moves drastically improved the customer experience and propelled online sales.\\nTo further build on its digital momentum, Chipotle this year is rolling out its loyalty reward program nationally that has already racked up a million members. The company began testing Chipotle Rewards last year in some markets, with promising results. It also plans to add dedicated drive-through lanes for picking up orders placed through its popular mobile app at some stores.\\nThe other move that helped win back customers was Chipotle’s revamp of its food-handling practices, such as adopting quarterly food-safety training for employees and putting in place a new food-preparation system.\\nThe result of these positive developments has been that analysts are fast changing their revenue expectations for the restaurant giant. According to analysts' average estimates, Chipotle is likely to post 24% average growth in profitability per year during the next five years, a sharp rebound from the past five-year period when growth sank to negative 17% per year.\\nIn the quarter that ended in March, profit is likely to grow to $2.94 a share, up from $2.13 a share a year ago, while sales are forecast to jump about 10% to $1.26 billion, according to analysts’ average estimates.\\nBottom Line\\nEven after such a robust comeback, we don’t believe Chipotle stock has run its course, as some analysts believe. We think the stock will continue to benefit from the company's turnaround process and the leadership qualities of its CEO Brian Niccol.\\nHe has been a powerful force in the bid to regain customer confidence and bring back operational discipline to a business that was teetering on the brink of disaster just three years ago. The restaurant chain's earnings report next week is likely to support our bullish view. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

So, what's turned Twitter’s outlook around so radically? Why, in such a short period of time, are its future prospects so altered that even the company’s severest critics have been forced to change their negative opinions on the company?\\nWe think Twitter's positive momentum is all about the company's success at making its platform a destination for interactions between a much broader audience than what it originally was—a site monopolized mostly by journalists, politicians and entertainers.\\nStreaming Video The Game Changer\\nTwitters’ Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jack Dorsey has been able to generate that momentum mainly via the site's streaming video offerings—a key part of his turnaround strategy, which has started to pay off. Twitter’s partnerships with news outlets and sports leagues are attracting a variety of top advertisers including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and AT&T (NYSE:T). These advertisers are loving the opportunity to place their ads directly in user timelines; they're also appreciating the possibility of running brand campaigns next to live broadcasts.\\nDuring the fourth quarter, the number of active, daily users rose by 12%, Twitter’s fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year growth. The company also says video advertising is now its most popular ad format.\\nInvestors are welcoming the new direction. Their appreciation has pushed Twitter shares higher by 30% this year, making it one of the top performing technology stocks so far in 2018.\\nStill, despite the recent gains, there's a long journey ahead for Twitter, before it can fully catch up to the competition. With 330 million monthly active users, Twitter has managed to attract only a fraction of the digital advertising market compared to Facebook, which has over 2 billion monthly users.\\nSustainable Momentum?\\nThe biggest question going forward is whether the company can sustain this momentum in the rapidly-changing landscape for social media companies. This will be especially salient now that politicians are seriously reconsidering the regulatory environment surrounding consumer privacy protections after Facebook's disastrous data breech, perpetrated by Cambridge Analytica. Additionally, Twitter will also have to contend with another issue that Facebook is currently addressing: how to stop anti-state elements from misusing these social media platforms.\\nAll these challenges notwithstanding, one thing is certain. Twitter's survival is no longer in question. It’s now an established social media player that's managed to position itself to take advantage of the weakness of its biggest rival, in the aftermath of Facebook's crisis of credibility in this post-Cambridge Analytica world.\\nBottom Line\\nWe see a double-digit jump in its share price, which closed yesterday at $31.22, if Twitter reports another blow-out quarter on Wednesday morning. The Street sees revenue rising by 10% to $605.3 million, with profits of $0.12 per share, up from just $0.07 per share a year earlier.\\nOne of the key statistics to watch tomorrow is the number of daily active users Twitter reports. Any additional improvement in this number may trigger another round of speculation regarding a potential acquisition of Twitter by a cash-rich player, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nReports Thursday, October 25, after the market close\\nRevenue Expectation: $34.04B\\nEPS: $10.4\\n\\nIn a market where nothing looks attractive after a month of extreme volatility, especially in the tech sector, it’s tough to focus on individual stocks. But if you're investing for the long-term, there are still appealing opportunities, particularly after the recent sell-off.\\nWeekly GOOGL Chart: November 2017-Present\\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Google's parent company is surely one of them. Hurt by the negative macro environment, data privacy concerns, and political scrutiny, Google shares have lost their momentum since the company's second quarter earnings report. Trading at almost $1,115 as of yesterday's close, Google shares are down about 14% from their record high of $1,291.44 in July.\\nWithout question Alphabet is one of our premier buy recommendations, particularly during a market pullback. Indeed, we believe investors are selling this tech giant for all the wrong reasons.\\nYou can count on one hand the number of companies that bring in more than $100 billion in annual sales and produce double-digit revenue growth each year. Alphabet has been doing this for at least two years.\\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet posted a 25% jump in net revenue from the same period a year ago. That was the fastest rate of revenue growth for the internet advertising services behemoth in four years. We believe Google is in a strong position to deliver a similar performance this quarter and post growth that’s greater than 20% when it reports its third quarter numbers on Thursday.\\nAnalysts, on average, expect 22% revenue growth, to $27.3 billion, driven primarily by the company’s digital ad business, on adjusted earnings per share of $10.4.\\nExpanding Beyond The Ad Business\\nIf concern for Alphabet's reliance on the core ad business is keeping you on the sidelines, then take note of how quickly the company’s “other revenue” segment is growing. In the second quarter, that category jumped 37%, making it Google's fastest growing line item.\\nGoogle Cloud, hardware, and Google Play, along with the company's self-driving vehicle unit, Waymo, are the future growth engines for the company. Each will bring much needed diversification to Google’s sales. While Waymo is just in its infancy, it’s still a major leader in the autonomous driving segment. Morgan Stanley recently assigned Waymo a valuation of $175 billion.\\nWe also like Alphabet because of its strong economic moat. We don’t see a single competitor that's posing a serious challenge to Google dominance in the digital ad arena.\\nThis year Google has been under pressure, on concerns that the new privacy laws introduced by the European Union in May would hurt its advertising business. So far, however, these changes haven’t impacted the company’s bottom line and we believe that threat is mainly out of the way. Its Q3 earnings report will give us a clearer idea of developments on that front.\\nFrom a valuation perspective, Alphabet also looks cheaper than its peers. It trades at 47 times trailing earnings, below Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 51 times and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) 140 times valuation.\\nBottom Line\\nGoing into its the third quarter earnings report, Alphabet shares may appear to be vulnerable to market volatility and the negative macro backdrop. Still, fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with the company’s current growth drivers and its future potential. For long term investors, any weakness in share pricing should be taken as a buying opportunity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nReports Q4 2018 results on Thursday, February 7, before the market opens\\nRevenue expectation: $869.5 million\\nEPS expectation: $0.25\\n\\nWith the risk of government regulations on user privacy threatening to impede the growth trajectory of social media stocks, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to choose a potential winner from among this group. There's no doubt that regulatory intervention will make it much harder for sector players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and even LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) to monetize user data.\\nOne way to make a better investment decision in this highly unstable situation is to focus on those companies which have been upfront about trolling and malicious content on their site and quick about removing spammy material from their platform, while winning ad dollars at the same time.\\nTWTR Weekly 2016-2019\\nTwitter is emerging as a winner on both these fronts. The San Francisco-based company has created its own momentum within the highly negative environment for social media stocks this past year. Shares gained 33% during the past 12 months, a period in which Facebook fell 5% and the benchmark NASDAQ was up just 6%.\\nMassive Cleanup, Video Content Paying Off\\nBy quickly acting to clean up its platform, Twitter has convinced investors they should ignore user engagement numbers while the company makes its platform more acceptable to regulators. During the quarter that ended in September, Twitter’s monthly active users averaged 326 million. That’s a decrease of 9 million from the second quarter. Twitter warned in its July earnings report of a continued drop in that critical metric as a result of efforts to divest itself of questionable users and comply with stricter privacy rules in Europe.\\nIn our view Twitter is playing it smart. In the current environment regulatory scrutiny will only increase as data breach issues continue across the sector.\\nTwitter has provided investors with transparency, by adopting an open approach to problems within its network. CEO Jack Dorsey has been warning investors since last summer that his platform won’t see user growth while the company carries out its massive cleanup operation.\\nYet even as its aggressive cleanup exercise continues, Twitter has successfully squeezed out more revenue from advertisers, even while user growth has tailed off over the past two quarters.\\nAs was highlighted in our previous post about Twitter, the company's success in attracting ad dollars is largely the result of its push to expand video content. That’s resonating very well with advertisers. We believe this strategy, which is one of the main components of Dorsey’s turnaround plan, will continue to strengthen Twitter’s appeal. The video segment now accounts for more than half of Twitter's ad revenue.\\nTwitter's real-time highlights and video partnerships have positioned the company as a broadcast and communications network, making it complementary to all other forms of media, including TV. Twitter is also well positioned to benefit from the large shift in dollars toward mobile and native advertising.\\nBottom Line\\nWith meaningful progress toward improving its content quality and advertisers’ willingness to value the platform’s transparency and strength, we believe Twitter will be able to attract additional user engagement going forward. The decline in the number of users will stop at some point this year.\\nThese two factors will help Twitter stock, which closed yesterday at $34.37, continue its upward trajectory. We remain bullish on its long-term prospects. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWith equity markets continuing their exuberance, and investors shrugging off the negative impact of an escalating trade war, US benchmark indices last week reached new highs. It seems there's little that can stop this remarkable bull run.\\nNevertheless, some of the world’s biggest companies have been cautioning of the negative effects of the new US tariffs on Chinese imports. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer, has reportedly warned the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, in a letter, that the big-box retailer may have to raise prices to combat tariff costs.That letter is the most recent red flag, following similar concerns expressed by other large multinationals, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Samsonite International (OTC:SMSEY).\\nIn addition to the roiling trade spat, in the coming week investor focus will shift to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday, for which the market consensus expects another quarter-point rate hike in an economy experiencing the strongest job growth in 49 years. Investors should watch for the Fed’s assessment of the health of the US economy, inflationary pressures, and the impact of the trade war between the US and China.\\nAs a potentially busy week commences, here are three stocks that could see some price action in the coming week:\\n1. Nike \\nNike, (NYSE:NKE), the Beaverton, Oregon-based manufacturer of athletic footwear, clothing and accessories, is expected to release financial results for fiscal Q1 2019 on Tuesday, after the market close. The consensus EPS for the quarter is $0.53 a share, according to Reuters’ estimate of analysts’ forecasts.\\nNKE Weekly\\nJudging by its sales momentum in the US, there is a good chance that the sportswear giant will beat analyst expectations. Trading just a hair below its record high of $86.04, Nike shares closed on Friday at $85.55. The stock is up more than 60% in the past year, proving it's one of the best dividend stocks to own in this bull market.\\nThe biggest sign that the company is on the right track to deliver superior returns is the revival of its sales growth in North America. After three quarters during which US sales contracted, the company reversed that trend in the second quarter as consumers flocked back to malls, encouraged by a strong economy, tax cuts and rising wages.\\nThis positive reversal in the domestic market comes at a time when Nike remains a powerful brand overseas, from where the company generates more than half its revenue. Still, with most of these expectations already priced in, it’s unlikely that Nike shares will see a big jump even if it beats on expectations.\\n2. Conagra Brands\\nThe Chicago-based frozen food giant will report its fiscal 2019 first-quarter earnings on Thursday, before the market opens. Analysts expect $0.56 a share earnings for the period ended August 31, according to Reuters’ estimates.\\nCAG Weekly\\nThe latest earnings for Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) will be keenly watched by investors after the retailer announced a $8.1-billion cash and stock deal to buy Pinnacle Foods (NYSE:PF) this past June, betting big on the revival of frozen food demand. Investors, however weren't so thrilled.\\nThey sent Conagra stock tumbling the day it announced the deal, on concerns that the purchase was too expensive even as it bolsters Conagra’s footprint in the freezer-aisle with brands such as Birds Eye. After the June plunge, the stock remains highly volatile. Shares closed Friday at $37.45.\\nIf there's any sign of weakness in its frozen food segment, during the report, expect another sell-off. It's going to be tough for Conagra to justify the price it paid for the Pinnacle deal.\\n3. Tilray\\nKeep an eye on the most speculative segment of the market. That's where British Columbia-based medical marijuana company Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) gave investors a roller coaster ride filled with highs and lows of great magnitude during the past week.\\nTLRY 300 Minute Chart\\nIn a classic boom-and-bust cycle, shares closed at $123 on Friday, trading more than 50% below where they hit on Wednesday, at a record $300 per share for the stock, after CEO, Brendan Kennedy, told CNBC that investment in cannabis companies “is a global opportunity.”\\nHis remarks were driven by Tilray having gained approval, just a day earlier, from the US Drug Enforcement Administration to import medical cannabis into the US for testing purposes. Investor interest in marijuana companies has also swelled ahead of Canada’s legalization of recreational cannabis use next month.\\nThe latest investor frenzy was fueled by Constellation Brands (NYSE:NYSE:STZ), the maker of Corona beer, when it announced a $3.8 billion investment in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) last month, signaling that global players also see value in this growing segment of the market.\\nIf the sell-off in Tilray accelerates during the coming week, it may vindicate investor apprehension that the sector is in a bubble territory. That could be a heads-up that a big correction could be on the way. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIt’s been a game of nerves for Facebook’s investors this year.\\nThe stock is trading near an all-time high after a tumultuous start to the year. Shares sank in mid-March amid a wave of extremely negative developments that raised doubts about the future of this social media giant.\\nFacebook (FB) 1-Year Chart\\nRiding successfully through analysts’ downgrades, the intense scrutiny by regulators following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the “delete Facebook” campaign, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is back in the game. Investors will get another glimpse of how the company is coping with these negative pressures when the it releases its second-quarter earnings report after the market close on Wednesday.\\nThe consensus at the Street shows another blowout quarter, with revenue rising to $13.35 billion, up from $9.32 billion in the year-ago period, and adjusted earnings per share rising to $1.71 from $1.59.\\nWe see some risks to the valuation that could come from increased regulation around the management of its user data. But overall, we remain convinced that Facebook will overcome these challenges and its stock still has a lot of room to run.\\nInstagram and WhatsApp Will Be the Big Guns\\nSo far, there has been no evidence that shows that controversies, such as the spread of fake news, Russian interference in the U.S. elections and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, have prompted advertisers to divert ad dollars.\\nFacebook remains the dominant force in social media. Companies can’t afford to ignore it. With the maturing Facebook platform in North America, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has many drivers that will continue to fuel growth over the long term.\\nInstagram reached 1 billion monthly active users in June. This platform is attracting new users faster than Facebook’s main site and is on track to exceed 2 billion users within the next five years. With a younger audience, Instagram is much more attractive to advertisers.\\nAnd the contribution of Instagram to Facebook’s revenue has been stunning during the past few quarters. Instagram could make up about 16% of Facebook’s revenue over the next year, up from 10.6% last year, according to eMarketer data cited by Bloomberg Intelligence. Facebook doesn't separate Instagram revenue contribution in its financial statements.\\nAnother property that is ripe to contribute to Facebook’s bottom line is its highly popular WhatsApp messaging application, which has more than 1.5 billion users. In an announcement early this year, WhatsApp said it would begin allowing business accounts for the first time, a step that lays the groundwork for this free service to start making money for its parent.\\nStill a Tremendous Growth Story\\nThe recent performance of Facebook suggests that the worst is over. As we have said in our earlier articles, there may be some more negative surprises, especially when the company is still in the middle of a major restructuring and many governments are still contemplating ways to strengthen online privacy regulation.\\nBut that shouldn’t discourage long-term investors to hold this tremendous growth stock in their portfolio. Facebook has a lot of firepower to deal with these temporary setbacks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWalt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders may have little reason to be cheerful after seeing the company’s latest earnings report on Aug. 6. It didn’t give them what they wanted: the continuation of the streak of earning wins that have pushed its stock to a record high this year.\\nInstead, the shares of the House of Mouse took their worst beating in nearly four years after missing on profit forecasts in a quarter which saw the opening of the most highly anticipated theme-park attraction in the company’s history. The shares plummeted almost 5% on Aug. 7, though they recovered some of those losses yesterday to close at $137.89.\\nDisney price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfit at the company’s domestic resorts fell in the quarter after the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge in the Disneyland resort in Anaheim, California, failed to attract large crowds, dragging the segment lower. Further adding to the disappointment was the poor performance from the company’s film division.\\nDespite the releases of “Avengers: Endgame,” the highest-grossing movie of all time, as well as “Aladdin” and “Toy Story 4,” that division also fell short on expectation as “Dark Phoenix,” a Marvel movie inherited in the $71 billion acquisition of Fox assets, flopped, forcing the company to take a write-off.\\nTechnically, the setback in one quarter shouldn’t change much for Disney: the company has shown strong earnings momentum during the past year in which CEO Bob Iger worked quite successfully on his turnaround plan to spur growth. Even after the deep dive on Aug. 7, Disney shares are still up almost 26% this year, compared with a 16% expansion for the S&P 500 Index.\\nDisney’s Ambitious Growth\\nThat being said, what’s worrying investors is that Disney is losing its earnings momentum at a time when it’s entering one of the most ambitious growth plans of its recent history. The company is investing heavily to win back subscribers who decamped to streaming providers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:NFLX).\\nDisney had earlier warned that 2019 would mark a tough fiscal year as the company goes through an internal transition after acquiring most of 21st Century Fox, even as it develops programs for its flagship Disney+ service scheduled to be launched on Nov. 12.\\nWith its earnings report, Disney announced that it is pricing a new bundle of streaming services at a surprisingly low $12.99 a month, with a package that includes family programming, live sports and a vast library of television shows. The entertainment giant announced that the combined pricing for Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu will represent nearly 30% discount to their individual prices.\\nBut all this means higher costs and lower profitability if Disney’s traditional businesses aren’t there to quickly fill that gap. In the last quarter, spending on movies and TV shows for new online services resulted in a $553 million loss in Disney’s direct-to-consumer division.\\nThat figure may balloon to $900 million in the current quarter, Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, said on the earnings call. The service is likely to have between 60 million and 90 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024, the year in which the company expects to achieve profitability on this segment.\\nBottom Line\\nDespite Q3 setback, we don’t think Disney shares have lost their appeal. It was no secret that 2019 was going to be a transition year for Disney, as the company takes Fox assets on board and spends on investing in the three direct-to-consumer products.\\nWe find in Disney a powerful brand with a lot of growth momentum. It priced its streaming product competitively and that will make it hard for consumers to ignore its Disney+ services, offering rich content and a lot of variety. For these reasons, this week's pullback in Disney’s stock creates the ideal entry point for those who were sitting on the sidelines. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAmid chaos and confusion in stock markets, it’s often tough to remain focused and invest strategically. But after elevated volatility there are almost always a few dips worth buying. Last week was one such opportunity for investors. U.S. indices went through some crazy, wild swings, before finishing their worst week in two years.\\nThe S&P 500 plunged 5.2% for the week, its biggest slide since January 2016, reminding equity investors that what goes up must, eventually, come down. At one point, stocks fell 12% from the highs they hit early this month. This indiscriminate selloff has wiped out all the gains for 2018.\\nFor many smart investors, though, this kind of volatility provides a perfect entry. Finally, after two years of big gains and rising valuations, there are stocks you can now buy at bargain rates. While there are plenty of opportunities in this market—which reversed its direction when there was no apparent threat to the economy—I will highlight two stocks you might consider adding to your portfolio now.\\n1. Apple\\nAAPL Daily\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have dropped more than 9% this year as investors shunned this Cupertino-based tech giant on concerns that its cycle of super growth is over and future growth isn’t that promising. Trading at $156.41 at the time of writing, this stock suddenly looks affordable again, following its 14% plunge from the record high of $178 it hit just last month.\\nThis negative momentum, I think, reflects the fact that investors are not thinking rationally about the long-term potential of Apple’s growth. The company has a consistent record of surprising investors and beating the broader market. And I don’t think the situation will be different going forward.\\nShares of Apple have soared over 750% during the last 10 years — that's more than eight times the return of the S&P 500. Apple become the largest U.S. company by market capitalization a few years ago.\\nDuring its Q1 2018 report on February 1, Apple also announced a plan to bring back to the U.S. its $285-billion cash hoard which has been sitting overseas and to further increase the size of its capital-return plan via dividends and share buybacks.\\nThis aggressive share buyback plan shows the financial muscle Apple has, with which to defend its per-share earnings on the stock price going forward.\\nI believe this current downturn is an overreaction. As such it presents a rare buying opportunity for long-term investors. There is no doubt that Apple’s sales are showing some weakness if you look at its latest earnings report, but I don’t think one or two quarters of underperformance is enough to derail this company which has a rock-solid balance sheet. This strength makes Apple stock a buy now and on any further weakness.\\n2. Mastercard\\nMA Daily\\nMastercard (NYSE:MA), which closed at $165.20 a share on Friday, looks like a steal to me after its 7% drop from its 52-week high. This payments-processing behemoth has been consistent in providing superior returns to investors, thanks to strong consumer spending and the global shift in payments from paper to plastic.\\nMA Monthly 2013-2018\\nThe stock has been on a tear during the past five years, up nearly 165% on rising sales and income. This recent pullback in its share price doesn’t mean much for this company’s long-term prospects when there is no sign that the world’s largest economy is slowing anytime soon.\\nThe catalyst for this stock market selloff actually came from a piece of good news, specifically a component of the monthly nonfarm payrolls report on February 2 showing surprisingly strong wage growth. For companies like Mastercard, rising wages mean people will have more money to spend on goods and services. So, in a normal trading environment, Mastercard should have continued its upward journey.\\nU.S. consumer spending—which accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's economic activity—accelerated at a 3.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest in three years, as household incomes continued to rise.\\nAs for Mastercard, in the fourth quarter, the company earned $1.14 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.12, while the company's net revenue jumped 20% to $3.31 billion. Globally, Mastercard is also firing on all cylinders. Cross-border volumes — the value of transactions made by overseas cardholders — rose 22.4% on a U.S. dollar-converted basis in the fourth quarter.\\nIn the company's Q4 earnings call this month, Mastercard revised its three-year growth projections higher, forecasting revenue growth of 13% to 14% through 2018, and compound EPS growth through the mid-20s.\\nBottom line: Despite the recent correction, the fundamental story for some great growth stocks, such as Apple and Mastercard, hasn’t changed. If these stocks continue to slide, or if the market remains volatile, it’s the ideal time to buy additional shares of Apple and Mastercard at what now seem to be more reasonable prices. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe current market rally that's propelled US benchmark indices including the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite to new all-time highs this week seems to have done nothing for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares. The stock of the world’s largest social media company, which closed last night at $176.26, is down almost 20% from its 52 week high of $218.62 in late July.\\nThat historic plunge, which began on July 25 after Facebook warned during its Q2 2018 earnings report that revenue growth would continue to slow during the second half of the year, wiped out a record $119 billion in value. Since then, shares of the social media behemoth have shown no sign of life.\\nFB Weekly\\nFacebook shares recovered strongly from previous corrections, having proven to be great buy-on-the-dip opportunities, but this time is different. Shares have continued to languish even as other tech giants have fully participated in the market’s most recent bull run.\\nFor the full year of 2018 so far, the stock is down 2%, trading at the lowest level since April. The upward momentum for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the other hand, doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon; shares for those companies have risen 27% and 63%, respectively for the year.\\nStill A Dip-Buying Opportunity?\\nIf you’re just entering the game, thinking to buy Facebook stock on the dip, the big question is whether this strategy will work this time.That’s a million-dollar question and probably too tough for market pundits to answer. After all, the company is still recovering from its biggest crisis since its 2012 IPO.\\nIn our view, Facebook remains a solid long-term play despite all the setbacks the company has faced this year, events ranging from a Russian intervention in the U.S. presidential elections via Facebook as well as other social media platforms, to the Cambridge Analytica data breech scandal that triggered a global push for scrutiny around the company’s data privacy practices.\\nAmid the daily market noise, it’s tough to stay focused on Facebook's bigger picture. Despite all the negative press and government scrutiny, Facebook remains the most powerful media platform for advertisers. According to the latest data collected by Apptopia, 32% of the time spent on one of the top 100 apps in the world was on a Facebook-owned app.\\nUsers spent 300 billion hours on Facebook-owned apps in the three months from May through July. That's more than double the amount of time spent on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) apps.\\nStock Holding Its Ground\\nAfter giving the initial shock to investors when the company announced disappointing second-quarter earnings, Facebook shares are holding their ground. That shows that most of the bad news is already fully baked into the stock. Barring any additional negative surprises, shares should resume their upward momentum soon.\\nWithout doubt the issues that the company faced this year have severely impacted the future expectations on both growth and margins, but Facebook is still making money. In fact, it’s making a lot of money. Based on current analyst estimates, Facebook is forecast to grow revenue by 37% and earnings about 34% for the fiscal 2018.\\nFor the company, the biggest challenge will be convincing investors that while Facebook's days of easy growth are over, it still operates the most advertiser prized social media properties. Indeed, WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram have more than 1 billion users each. The entire Facebook suite of products has 2.5 billion monthly users.\\nWe believe this provides a lot of ammunition for Mark Zuckerberg with which to engineer a quick turnaround and exceed expectations. As well, we don't think this isn’t too much to expect from a company that reported sales growth averaging 50% during the past 10 quarters and has a remarkable track record of surprising analysts quarter after quarter.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nIt’s tough to be a Facebook bull right now. The company’s growth is slowing and there's little hope for an upside in the short-run. But if you’re willing to bet on the stock over the longer term— say for the next five to 10 years—there is a little reason to be bearish on the company. At the moment Facebook fundamentals are worsening, but its core business continues to remain highly promising. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nShrugging off a disappointing end to US-China trade talks, the threat of additional interest rate hikes, and the most recent political uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s administration, investors sent the S&P 500 to a new record high to finish the week, ending a six-month drought during which equities tumbled into a correction.\\nRobust second-quarter earnings and the continued strength of the US economy have been the primary catalysts for the continuation of this decade-old bull run, which is the longest in history by some measures. While the Q2 earnings season is almost over, there are still a few high-profile earnings reports from key sectors of the economy in the week ahead which could keep this market momentum going and help shape investor views about the future.\\nBelow are two stocks that could move on their earnings reports this coming week and a third stock that continues to garner investor and analyst interest for a variety of reasons:\\n1. Best Buy\\nQ2 Report Date: Tuesday, August 28 before market open | Consensus expectations - EPS:$0.83; Revenue: $9.25B\\nBBY Weekly\\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is the last remaining household retail name which has yet to report Q2 earnings. Judging by the strong performance of other retailers, as well as Best Buy’s key suppliers, during this earnings season, chances are good that this Minnesota-based purveyor of electronic products is going to surpass analyst expectations on both sales and net income.\\nIndeed, earlier this month, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported that its second-quarter \"electronics comp sales were the strongest in 4 years”, while the personal computer supplier Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY) reported a 19% jump in its first-quarter revenue, both beating estimates by wide margins.\\nWall Street consensus for Tuesday\\'s release is for $0.82 a share earnings on revenue of $9.27 billion. These estimates represent year-over-year growth of 19% and 37%, respectively. Buoyed by these bullish expectations, Best Buy shares have gained 8% since August 15, adding to the 33% jump in its stock price during the past one year.\\nBut history tells us that an earnings beat on its own probably won’t be enough to satisfy Best Buy bulls. Shares of this retailer plunged more than 8% after the company\\'s Q1 earnings call in May, when the company said it was holding its full-year guidance steady.\\n2. Salesforce.com\\nEarnings Report Date: Wednesday, August 29 after market close | Consensus expectations - EPS $0.47; Revenue: $3.23B\\nCRM Weekly\\nSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which sells software and cloud-based services to corporate clients, is among those high-flying technology stocks that have been benefiting from a global surge in IT spending. There are no signs that this trend will be changing anytime soon. The San Francisco-based company has consistently beaten analyst estimates on earnings and sales and investors have high hopes for the company\\'s Q2 report as well.\\nIn its most recent guidance, the company said it expected sales to increase to $3.23 billion, up from analyst projections of $3.1 billion, as the company sees benefits from its largest-ever acquisition, of MuleSoft a provider of platforms for building application networks. The deal, completed in May, is helping Salesforce become a serious competitor in cloud-based computing.\\nHeading into its Q2 earnings report, Salesforce shares have had an impressive run—rising 49% this year and moving closer to analysts\\' 12-month consensus price estimate of $156 a share. Another earnings beat and bullish forecast will likely fuel additional gains.\\n3. Tesla\\nTSLA Weekly\\nBeyond just earnings, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has kept investors guessing throughout the year—about the future of its stock and the company itself. This coming week could turn out to be more of the same.\\nIn a blog post published late Friday, chairman, CEO, founder and largest shareholder Elon Musk announced that he is jettisoning his plan to take Tesla private after more than two weeks of tweeting that he had funding in place to remove his electric car manufacturing company from public markets.\\n“I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public. The Board indicated that they agree,” Musk said in Friday\\'s post. Tesla stock has plunged 17% since August 8 amid speculation about how the company would raise money to take Tesla private.\\nNow that this particular point of speculation has been retired, investors will likely once again shift their focus back to issues surrounding the company’s liquidity and Model 3 production targets. Get set for another bumpy ride this week. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nConsensus is emerging in the market that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next move will be a cut in interest rates. The bond markets, for example, are pricing in the assumption that the Fed will make at least two quarter-percentage point cuts this year due to the increasing risk of recession.\\nThat pessimism, in our view, isn’t without reason. The U.S.-China trade war has started to hurt investor sentiment and, more importantly, is now forcing companies to cut their revenue forecasts.\\nWith corporate America beginning to feel the pain, a growing number of economic indicators are also flashing red. The New York Fed’s Empire State Manufacturing Index, released on Monday, showed the biggest monthly decline since the last recession.\\nIf these market readings are correct and the Fed is ready to cut interest rates, then it makes sense for equity investors to seek shelter and add some safety to their portfolios. Stocks that generally outperform in a slowing economy are those that pay regular dividends. To help you get started, we have picked the following two income-producing stocks to help ride through the market volatility:\\n1. NextEra Energy\\nIt’s not unusual for utility stocks to outperform the market in times of distress. Their business model based on recurring cash flows and their ability to pay regular dividends are some of the traits that attract investors. That’s the main reason the utility sector has continued to be one of the best performers this year with the S&P 500 Utilities gaining more than 13%.\\nIn this space, we particularly like Nextera Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE), the Florida-based utility that has scaled up by providing clean energy. NextEra is the largest U.S. provider of renewable power, generating electricity from the wind and sun. It operates a large natural gas pipeline business as well as a growing energy storage operation.\\nThe big difference between NextEra and other traditional utility companies is that its growth wasn’t funded by a massive injection of debt. Instead, the company very smartly used government subsidies and tax breaks offered to clean power producers. It mostly sells the output to old-school utilities, many of which must procure power from green sources to meet state mandates.\\nNextEra Energy price chart\\nNextEra plans to invest $40 billion on its development projects through the end of next year. This should help fuel growth, especially at a time when the renewable market opportunity is huge and the company has already built an impressive scale. Shares closed yesterday down 0.5% at $205.38, but have advanced 19% this year versus the S&P 500's gains of 17%.\\nWith a dividend yield of 2.45%, NextEra pays an annual dividend of $5 a share. The company plans to grow that between 12%-14% through the end of 2020.\\n2. Welltower\\nJust like utility stocks, real estate income trusts, or REITs, are also a bet on the direction of interest rates. Their yield becomes attractive once the rates on safe haven government bonds fall.\\nWelltower Inc (NYSE:WELL), one of the largest healthcare-focused REITs, is an attractive option to consider if you’re looking to earn a higher yield. The company manages more than 1,500 properties and is focused on healthcare — a relatively safe bet within REITs due to the ageing population in the U.S. and increased spending on such facilities.\\nIts portfolio has a good mix of facilities to take advantage of this shift, including senior housing, outpatient medical facilities, and long-term care. These revenue-generating streams are solid, especially when the U.S. is going through a huge demographic shift where, according to some estimates, 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 each day.\\nWelltower price chart\\nWelltower is already benefiting from this trend. Its net income jumped 61% last year and is expected to grow a further 29% to around $1 billion in 2019, assuming the company meets the low-end of its profit guidance. The shares fell 0.7% to $83.04 yesterday, which only slightly dented it's almost 20% gain so far this year.\\nOver the past decade, this REIT has boosted its payout to $3.48 a share annually, which translates to a yield of more than 4% at the current stock price.\\nBottom Line\\nAfter a powerful rally in income-producing stocks fueled by low interest-rate expectations, these two names may not have much more room to the upside. Both NextEra and Welltower are trading close to their 52-week highs and their valuations seem a bit stretched at the moment.\\nBut if the bond market is correct and we’re soon going to see a rate cut, we shouldn’t rule out another leg higher in the values of these stocks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIt wouldn't be an overexaggeration to say that, for markets, this coming week could be make or break. Some of the U.S.'s most powerful megacap companies report quarterly earnings.\\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average delivered its fifth straight week of gains. Fueling the price action: strong earnings momentum, hopes that the longest government shutdown in U.S. history was about to end and an expectation that the U.S.-China trade dispute may be getting closer to a resolution.\\nBut in the week ahead—when Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (BA) are all expected to report—which is the busiest in terms of earnings and future outlooks, there's an equal chance of this rally gaining additional momentum, or abruptly ending.\\nHere are the three most important earning reports to be released in the coming week. Stock investors simply can’t afford to ignore them.\\n1. Apple\\nAfter giving investors a shock ahead the company's earnings release early this month, in which the iPhone maker cut the sales outlook on its iconic smartphone, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may not have much more to add when it reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday, January 29 after the market close.\\nAAPL Weekly 2016-2019\\nOn average, analysts are expecting $4.17 a share profit, up from $3.89 a year ago. Sales are expected to decline $84.04 billion, down 5% from the same period a year ago. According to the company, that deceleration in sales is the result of weaker demand from China.\\nWhile trimming its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades, Apple indicated that sales will be about $84 billion in the quarter ended December 29, down from earlier estimates of $89 billion to $93 billion. This news has pressured Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) which have tumbled 32% since reaching a record high of $233.47 in early October. The stock closed at $157.76 on Friday.\\nIn our view, the two most important things investors would like to know from Apple's CEO Tim Cook during the company's earnings call are: how will he revive sales growth when customers aren’t willing to buy more expensive iPhones, and what else is in his bag of tricks to make up for the declining share of his flagship product on the company's total sales.\\n2. Facebook\\nThe world’s largest social media company, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will report Q4 2018 earnings on Wednesday, January 30 after the market close. Analysts on average expect EPS of $2.19, up from $1.44 a share a year ago. Sales are expected to gain 26% for the same period, to $16.4 billion.\\nFB Weekly 2016-2019\\nFacebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spent the past year dealing with the severe damage caused by the company’s failure to protect user privacy and stop the political manipulation of its platform by adversaries of the U.S. These two fiascos were such debacles, that the the social media giant had to completely change its policies relating to the merchandising of user data while also imposing strict controls over the spread of fake news on its platform.\\nThe company's upcoming earnings call will be important for investors since they might get some insight from Zuckerberg on how this crisis is affecting Facebook's return on investment. Markets are also eager to find out what plans he has to reinvigorate Facebook's sales growth to previous levels which strongly boosted shareholder value.\\nFacebook shares have lost about a third of their value since late July when the stock was trading at $218. Shares closed at $149 on Friday.\\n3. Amazon\\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world’s biggest e-commerce retailer, is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 earnings on Thursday, January 31 after the market close. Analysts are expecting $5.65 a share profit on average, more than double what the company delivered during the same period a year ago. Sales are expected to surge to $71.85 billion, about 19% higher than the same period a year ago.\\nAMZN Weekly 2016-2019\\nOne of the few tech sector companies still showing robust growth momentum, Amazon has been helped by strong U.S. consumer sentiment and a cyclical shift to online commerce. Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all performing remarkably, helping its shares outperform other tech stocks.\\nTrading at $1,670.57 as of Friday's close, Amazon shares surged 24% during the past month, suggesting that investor anticipation may be overhyped ahead of the company’s earnings report. Though Amazon is a great long-term investment, a slight miss versus expectations might generate a pullback at this point. We recommend proceeding with caution till after the report. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe downward spiral Snap finds itself in seems to have no end in sight. The share price of the social media giant traded near a record low yesterday after news reports that Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan is leaving the company in the middle of its turnaround.\\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) stock, which fell more than 2% at one point yesterday, has lost more than half of its value from its 52-week high as investors find it hard to believe that the company has found a way to meaningfully monetize its Snapchat app, one of the most popular sharing platforms among young people and the celebrities they follow.\\nSnap (SNAP) 1-Year Chart\\nKhan’s departure is the latest blow for CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel, who has faced a high executive turnover since the company’s initial public offering. In little over a year, he has lost or replaced Snap’s heads of finance, legal, engineering, product and sales.\\nKhan’s departure comes at a critical juncture for the company, which is struggling to show that it can survive in this very competitive environment for social media. In the second quarter, Snap missed Wall Street’s expectations for advertising sales as the redesign of its flagship product failed to generate excitement. In that quarter, Snap reported a decline in daily users for the first time.\\nThis bleak picture makes it very tough to get excited about the stock. But is it too a gloomy picture for a company that has more than 188 million users, who represent the most important demographic in the market? Snapchat’s disappearing posts, a feature known as Stories, was so popular with teenagers in the U.S. and Europe that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has made the concept a core part of its own services, most notably Instagram.\\nThis argument may have its appeal, but building a bull case for Snap shares even after they plunged to a record low doesn’t yet make sense. So far, there is no sign that the company could soon become a viable social platform that can generate strong revenue and defend its turf against much bigger rivals.\\nThe app attracted 10 million fewer users last quarter when compared with the same period a year ago. During this period, Facebook’s Instagram stole the show, with active users surpassing 1 billion for the first time.\\nFacebook, which copies almost every popular feature that Snap builds, seems a much better bet for social media investors. Snap generates $1.40 of revenue in terms of ads from each active user. That’s nowhere close to Facebook’s $9 per user.\\nA Tough Social Media Environment\\nSnap’s business fundamentals are deteriorating at a time when the operating environment for social media companies in general has become significantly challenging.\\nBig social media giants, including Facebook and Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are spending billions of dollars on their platforms to make them more secure and acceptable for regulators in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and allegations of Russian manipulations in the U.S. elections.\\nFor Snap, increasing its ad sales and outbidding much bigger competitors in this environment won’t be an easy task. The biggest issue that we have with Snap is that there aren't many unique features left about its app and it doesn’t make sense for advertisers to reward the company when its rival is doing much better.\\nThat said, there is one potential trigger for a powerful rally in Snap stock and that’s about Snapchat being acquired by a giant that has deep enough pockets to compete with Instagram. But for that to happen, we think Snap has to grow and acquire a significant scale to make a case for a premium valuation. Snap, in its current state, isn’t there yet. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAll eyes will be on some of the largest global tech companies, each scheduled to report earnings this coming week. These reports may make or break the market which is struggling to find a direction amid fears of accelerating inflation and an intensifying US-China trade war.\\nThis nervousness comes from the fact that equities have had their three worst sessions since April in the space of just eight days.\\nThis third-quarter earnings season has so far sent mixed signals. Evidence is mounting that inflationary pressures have started to hit the bottom lines of some industrial giants. In this environment of uncertainty and fear, all investors want to see is that America's tech giants, companies have powered the bull-run over the past decade, are still on track to produce earnings growth.\\nIn a week packed with earnings announcements, these three names are perhaps the most important for investor scrutiny.\\n1. Microsoft\\nWe're expecting another blowout quarter from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) when it reports its fiscal year 2018, first-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday October 24.\\nMSFT Weekly 2015-2018\\nIt’s difficult to put together a bearish call on Microsoft, no matter how hard its stock has been hammered during this correction. Shares closed at just under $109 on Friday, down from almost $116 earlier in October, off 6% in just a few weeks.\\nNevertheless, the company is firing on all cylinders following the successful execution of its turnaround strategy which focused on cloud computing and solidified the tech giant’s legacy businesses. Microsoft remains the leader in the desktop and laptop operating system market, with a commanding 88% market share.\\nIt's Office, which has been transformed into a subscription service for companies, continues to be a powerful driver of earnings. In the fourth quarter, revenue from cloud-computing platform Azure rose 89%, while sales of web-based Office 365 software to businesses climbed 38%.\\nFor Q1, Microsoft is forecasting revenue of between $27.35-$28.05 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.9% at the midpoint of guidance. The company is anticipating cost of goods of about $9.6 billion and operating costs of $9.25 billion. As per analysts consensus estimate, Microsoft will post $0.96 per share profit on revenue of $27.9 billion.\\n2. Alphabet\\nAny further weakness displayed by Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) during its third quarter earnings report on Thursday October 25 will provide a good buying opportunity if you're waiting on the sidelines.\\nGOOGL Weekly 2015-2018\\nAfter falling to $1105 as of Friday's close, more than 14% off its 52-week high of $1291, Alphabet shares have clearly been victimized by this volatile market. Indeed, it's become clear that investors are tarring some excellent companies with the same brush they're using for weaker peers. And Google certainly belongs in the former category.\\nWe expect strong growth in the company’s ad revenues, powered by its leading digital properties. However, investors should keep an eye on the cost side of the business at a time when major tech companies are beefing up spending to meet tightening user privacy regulations.\\nFor Q3 2018, the consensus analyst estimate for the company's revenue is $34.04 billion, a 23% jump year-over-year, on $10.45 earnings per share, up 9% from the same period a year ago.\\n3. Amazon\\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 earnings after the market close on Thursday, October 25. The consensus agrees that the world’s second most valuable company by market cap will again crush expectations based on its strong earnings momentum.\\nAMZN Weekly 2015-2018\\nThis sentiment is very much reflected in the company’s share price, which closed on Friday at $1764. Despite the stock's recent pullback, it's still up about 80% over the past 12 months, versus the S&P 500’s 7.48% gain during the same period.\\nIn the second quarter, sales surged 39% year-over-year and earnings per share soared almost 12-fold, helped by its cloud computing, advertising and other businesses, each of which continues to bring in more and more sales.\\nThe world’s largest e-commerce company is expecting third-quarter operating income to surge as much as $2.4 billion, while its sales will reach between $54-$57.5 billion. Wall Street analysts expect $3.11 earnings per share on sales of $57.1 billion.\\nAny weakness on a negative surprise will provide an ideal buying opportunity. Amazon continues to be an amazing business which is spending aggressively on new growth areas. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nLooking at the numbers right now for cannabis stocks might make you feel like you’ve already missed the biggest party of the year. The North American Marijuana Index—a measure of the largest growers, ancillary players, and cannabinoid-based drugmakers in North America—has tripled over the past 12 months and is up more than 600% since January 2016.\\nThese gains have been led by Canadian producers, including Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis (OTC:ACBFF).\\nTLRY vs CGC vs ACBFF\\nCanopy Growth, for example, has almost doubled so far this year, while Tilray is up more than 300% since its initial public offering in July. If you're not following the marijuana sector, you might be wondering what’s the investor rush all about?\\nThe biggest trigger of the eye-popping rally was Canada’s decision to legalize the recreational use of marijuana starting October 17. The assumption is lots of weed demand will shift to the legal market from the black market. Canadian adults spent C$5.7 billion ($4.39 billion) on marijuana last year, 90% of it for illegal, non-medical purposes, according to Statistics Canada.\\nBeyond Canada, marijuana use remains a federal crime in the US, but nine states and the District of Columbia already allow recreational consumption. Many countries, including the U.K. and Mexico, are in the process of approving use of medical marijuana, fueling expectations that global weed demand is going to surge.\\nTilray 300 Minute Chart\\nTilray stock jumped about another 12% Thursday after the medical-cannabis producer said it received regulatory approval to export more products to Germany. Tilray's medical-cannabis oil was already on shelves in German pharmacies. The company will soon be able to sell its whole-flower products as well, making it the only producer that sells both types in Germany.\\nA Vote of Confidence from the Booze Industry\\nAnother reason for big excitement for the marijuana sector is the increasing interest by global alcohol producers. Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), the maker of Corona beer, fueled the latest investor frenzy when it announced a $3.8 billion investment in Canopy last month, increasing its stake in the producer to 38%.\\nConstellation Brands Chief Operating Officer Bill Newlands said early this month that the cannabis industry on its way to becoming a worldwide business.\\n“This is not going to be limited to Canada,” Newlands said at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston. “This will undoubtedly be a market that develops in the United States. It’s developing around the world in places like Germany and Australia and other markets.”\\nSo, is it still worth dipping your toes and buying some top marijuana stocks? In our view, it’s hard to justify the valuations of some of the top companies and it seems a “bong bubble” is emerging.\\nTilray, valued at nearly $10 billion, currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of about 348. That’s more than 83 times higher than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the most valuable company in the S&P 500. And Canopy, with the market cap of around $6 billion, made about $60 million (C$77.9 million) in total revenue in fiscal 2018 while it was still losing money.\\nBottom Line\\nThere is no doubt that marijuana demand is surging globally and some of these companies will be able to translate that growth potential into sales. But buying at a point when these producers are entering an execution stage to prove that they can make money is a risky bet.\\nIf the demand assumptions that are fueling gains in these stocks prove wrong, we might see a big collapse in values. After all, weed is a commodity. And every commodity trade is cyclical in nature, going through boom-and-bust cycles.\\nBut if you’re a high-risk investor and you like speculative trades, then it’s better to stick with the market leaders, such as Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis. Those companies are expected to lead all growers in annual production and are well positioned to market their products. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWhen storms gather on the economic horizon, investors tend to move their funds from risky assets to so-called safe-havens — government bonds, utilities and consumer staples.\\nThese types of assets are considered safe because  they are able to generate reliable profits that offer a guaranteed stream of income in the form of dividends. That rush to safety has intensified this year, mainly due to the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China that, according to many analysts, has the potential to push the global economy into a recession.\\nIf you’re seeking refuge in this uncertain economic environment, the shares of the two big-box retailers — Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)  and  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) — offer a good alternative. \\n1. Walmart   \\nThe biggest concern that should be addressed when picking a safe-haven stock is whether the company is capable of producing strong cash flows when the economy is suffering and consumers are limiting their spending.\\nOn this metric, the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, fits the bill. Its large store network, massive power to squeeze its suppliers and its fast-improving online sales give it a safe haven status. The biggest evidence of this strength came this month when the retailer not only beat analysts’ expectations for its quarterly earnings, but also raised its full-year forecast. That suggests the retailer doesn’t see a big disruption in its earnings even if recession hits.\\nWalmart price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne factor that favors Walmart over others is its strong food-related sales. This makes it better insulated from the trade war than many competitors because food mostly comes from North America.\\nWith that strong market position, what’s more important for dividend investors is the company’s ability to provide regular cash. Walmart has a great track-record on this front as well. Since declaring its first dividend in March 1974, Walmart has raised its payout every single year.\\nGoing forward, there is still a lot of space for the retailer to continue rewarding its investors. In its fiscal year 2019, Walmart paid a $2.12 per share annual dividend out of its adjusted net income of $4.91 per share, keeping its payout ratio close to the ideal 40% mark. Trading at $112.42 at yesterday's close, Walmart shares have gained about 19% in the past 12 months.\\n2. Target\\nAfter judging Target on the same metrics we did Walmart, it’s not hard to conclude that this retailer, too, can withstand the economic downturn better than other competitors. In fact, shares of Target have proved a more lucrative trade when compared to Walmart this year — they've surged 58%, in the period, to close yesterday at $104.70. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index is up 14%.\\nTarget price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn recent quarters, Target has been able to deliver a strong performance despite fears that the U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariffs could escalate retailers' costs and hurt sales. For the second-quarter, Target reported both sales and profit gains last week, mainly achieved by attracting customers with compelling products, convenience and competitive pricing.\\nThe company also raised its full-year earnings guidance, projecting earnings of $5.90 to $6.20 a share, up from its previous range of $5.75 to $6.05 a share.\\nWith that growth momentum continuing, income investors who bought Target stock are also earning higher payouts each year. The company has been disbursing steadily increasing dividends every year for the last 48 years, while maintaining a fairly conservative payout ratio of 32.27% vs the industry average of 41.95%. Distributing an annual dividend of $2.64 per share, for a yield of 2.5%, its net quarterly income would cover its $0.66 quarterly payout more than twice.\\nBottom Line\\nThere is no doubt that investing in stocks is risky and doesn’t fit well in a highly conservative investing strategy. But if you want to diversify your portfolio with some exposure to equities, then both Walmart and Target offer solid income potential and a good hedge should the economy slow or slip into recession. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe first week of 2019 played out exactly as predicted. Volatility was at its peak and investors didn’t know what to do in this highly uncertain environment.\\nMajor US indices plunged on Thursday after Apple lowered guidance to a more dismal outlook for iPhone sales, citing a slowdown in China. Unfortunately, that was also the day that the ISM manufacturing Index report missed analysts’ expectations, raising fears that the US economy is hitting a slow patch after robust growth.\\nBut Friday was a different day entirely. US stocks rose sharply, bouncing back from their worst two-day start to a year since 2000, after the release of a strong jobs report and signs that the Federal Reserve will be flexible with its interest rate policy. Going forward, we don’t expect the current volatile trading pattern will change.\\nInvestors will buy on good news and sell when the headlines are bad. Here are three high profile stocks that could grab investor attention this week because of company-specific developments:\\n1. Apple\\nIt definitely has not been a good start to the year for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the world’s most highly valued tech giants.\\nAAPL Weekly\\nAfter the stock fell about 7% in 2018, the maker of iPhones began the new year with an almost 10% plunge on Thursday, subsequent to its shocking warning, which reduced fiscal first-quarter guidance, claiming it was due to the effects of a Chinese economic slowdown. Shares are now down more than 39% from the record high set in October.\\nWe expect the stock to rebound and reclaim some of its losses in the coming week if the good news flow continues. The company made a savvy move by releasing its major bad news before its fiscal Q1 earnings report, scheduled for January 29, after the close.\\nTechnicals also suggest that the selloff pressure was more than the stock deserved. After its 39% decline in just three months, Apple's weekly relative strength index chart is the most oversold it has been since the credit crisis, falling to around 30.\\n2. Bed, Bath & Beyond\\nIf US consumers continued to spend in the final three months of 2018, as reports of the holiday retail season suggest, then we’re going to see some evidence of this strength when the home furnishing giant, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) reports its fiscal Q3 earnings on Wednesday, January 9, after the market close.\\nBBBY Weekly 2016-2019\\nAnalysts on average are expecting earnings per share of $0.17 a share on sales of $3.04 billion. That would be a sharp decline from the same period a year ago when the home furnishings and cookware retailer reported $0.44 a share profit.\\nBed and Bath is struggling to bring more customers to its stores amid stiff competition from online retailers. Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares has said improvement is needed in its e-commerce function, but the company’s in-store promotions will be the key to keeping shoppers.\\nDuring the past quarter, the chain’s comparable sales fell 0.6%, marking a sixth straight quarter of contraction. Bed, Bath & Beyond's shares are down more than 45% during the past one year, adding to the slump that started in early 2015.\\n3. General Electric\\nWhen it comes to General Electric's (NYSE:GE) stock, there isn’t much to cheer about.\\nGE Weekly 2016-2019\\nThe once formidable global industrial conglomerate, and its stock, are struggling to survive after demand for its core products weakened. There don't seem to be any signs of improvement as 2019 begins.\\nOver the past one year, its shares have lost about 60% of their value. As well, the cash-strapped company almost entirely eliminated its once generous dividend—which now yields just 0.04%. The formerly reliable payouts once attracted millions of income-seeking shareholders.\\nOn the tail-end of this massive selloff, there are signs that the company’s restructuring is slowly moving forward. Friday, Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management LLC is talking to bankers about lining up debt to buy all or part of GE’s jet-leasing business, which could be worth as much as $40 billion.\\nShares of GE jumped 2% on the news and could continue their upward trajectory this coming week, if the New York-based alternative asset manager confirms the deal. It would raise considerable capital for GE and accelerate the dismantling of GE Capital, the financing arm that once accounted for half of the parent company’s profit.\\nGE is also taking steps to spin off its health-care unit. The ultimate goal: to narrow its focus to building jet engines and power equipment. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nAmong US high-flying technology stocks, it’s becoming tough to pick a right name for your buy-and-hold portfolio after the powerful rally of the past decade. In this uncertain environment, we have two major reasons why Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) might just be the ideal choice.\\nInvestors are confused as to which of the tech titans from the FANG group will successfully transition into the next phase of the technology boom, in which smart homes, driverless cars, and artificial intelligence will create new opportunities for wealth.\\nThe intense scrutiny that tech companies face these days also has investors concerned about future growth potential.\\nFacebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) shares, for example, have lost quarter of their value since late July. This is a direct result of concerns that the social media giant won’t be able to sustain its earnings momentum as it deals with data privacy issues and the threat of new legislation to increase oversight.\\nMonthly Google Chart: 2014-2018\\nDespite the uncertain environment for FANG stocks, there are a couple of names which have largely been unaffected by the negative sentiment. Google\\'s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of them. Here are two top reasons why we believe Google will withstand the selling pressure that is hurting other technology stocks and therefore justifies its long-term bull case.\\n1. Strong Moat\\nThe single wealth-building trait to look for in every stock you’re considering to buy is its economic moat, a term coined by the world’s most successful value investor, Warren Buffett.\\nIn his 2007 letter to shareholders, Buffett explains this concept:\\n\\n“A truly great business must have an enduring “moat” that protects excellent returns on invested capital. The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business ‘castle’ that is earning high returns…. Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company’s being the low-cost producer or possessing a powerful world-wide brand is essential for sustained success.”\\n\\nGoogle is definitely a company with a strong moat that is almost impossible to challenge. More than 90% of all internet searches take place through Google and its company subsidiary YouTube. Everyday, Google processes 3.5 billion searches that make its platform the most valuable for advertisers.\\nThat means companies have little choice but to advertise on Google\\'s platform. If your products and services don’t appear in a web search, people won\\'t be able to find you. Because of its huge internet presence, Google dominates the digital advertising market with a 40% control of the market globally.\\nThe latest evidence of this unparalleled superiority came in the second-quarter earnings report when the company posted 24% growth in its advertising business that pushed total Alphabet revenue to $26.24 billion.\\nThis massive growth came despite a regulatory backlash in Europe as well as mounting questions over Google’s massive data collection and clashes with advertisers over inappropriate content on YouTube.\\n2. Massive Firepower\\nInvesting in a wide-moat business is no guarantee that a stock will be a winner. If a technology company isn’t constantly innovating, nor investing in new growth areas, there is a good possibility that it will be left behind.\\nLuckily, Google, with its strong financial muscles, is at the forefront of new technology innovations that will fuel future revenue growth. In particular, self-driving car technology presents the greatest opportunity of all for Alphabet.\\nAccording to UBS, the self-driving car market will touch $2.8 trillion by 2030, and Alphabet venture, Waymo, has the potential to capture the 30% share in this market.\\nHome automation, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are other areas where Alphabet is spending aggressively to become the market leader. While speaking with analysts at a recent earnings calls, Alphabet\\'s chief financial officer Ruth Porat made it clear that the company will continue to spend on the new growth areas in order to remain a leader. Porat said in April:\\n\\n\"The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth.\"\\n“We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities.”\\n\\nBottom Line\\nGoogle is investing heavily to maintain, or even exceed its 20% growth in EPS each year. That means that with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 24, Google stock doesn’t look expensive at all.\\nWhile Google’s traditional growth drivers remain unchallenged and the company positions itself to grab a major share of new growth areas, it’s a no-brainer to stick with your Alphabet holdings. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nEditor's note: Ahead of Netflix's, Monday, July 16, Q2 2018 earnings report, after the close, here's an update on our analyst's call on the stock:\\n\\n“With so much positivity built into the share price, some investors have gotten nervous and moved to the sidelines ahead of the earnings reporting. These jitters were reflected in the stock price on Friday when Netflix fell about 4%, after closing at an all-time high on July 11. There will be a negative reaction if Netflix fails to provide strong subscriber guidance for Q3, or its Q2 net additions fall short of expectations.\\nHowever, we believe any pullback should be a buying opportunity for investors who are looking for a good entry point after such a powerful rally. We see Netflix as well-positioned to create long-term value and any temporary setback shouldn’t discourage long-term investors.”\\n\\nWhen it comes to crushing analyst expectations, very few technology firms can match what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) just delivered. Shares of the streaming-video powerhouse are currently trading about 15% higher than Wall Street’s consensus price estimate for the stock's value for the next 12 months.\\nNFLX Weekly TTM\\nAt $398 a share as of last night's close, Netflix is up more than 100% for just the first half of 2018. And that's after hitting a record high of $423 on June 21. Analysts are furiously playing catch-up, searching for a more accurate price target since their forecasts have been rendered meaningless.\\nNevertheless, these eye-popping gains are starting to make some investors nervous. They're wondering, perhaps correctly, whether Netflix can continue to deliver market-beating earnings. Of course, that begs the larger question—has Netflix become a dangerous buy?\\nHere are the main two reasons Netflix bears cite as to why the company’s valuation has grown frothy, as well as our response to their anxiety.\\n1. Soaring Debt\\nWhile building content that’s unique, fresh and entertaining for its 125 million global subscribers, Netflix has amassed a hefty $8.5 billion worth of debt. That's a level of borrowing that's unlikely to shrink anytime soon. Indeed, according to Moody’s, Netflix is likely to add another $15 billion to its debt load in order to fund production of original content in the coming years.\\nTo justify that elevated level of leverage, Netflix has to become net-cash-flow-positive in the next five years, says Moody's. That means the company must continue generating robust subscriber growth each year. As a benchmark, the streaming service added 26 million subscribers in the past 12 months to March 31.\\nIf it can sustain that torrid pace, combined with increases to its subscription fee, Netflix should become cash flow positive when its number of subscribers jumps from the current 125 million to 200 million, something that's forecast to occur by the end of 2021.\\nIf you’re planning to buy Netflix stock today, that’s the key number you should be watching. Any lapses on this metrics will trigger an immediate selloff, ending this remarkable rally. Thus far the market has been willing to ignore Netflix’s massive leverage and weighty cash burn, as long as the company continues to beat estimates each quarter while issuing bullish subscriber forecasts.\\n2. Competitive Threats\\nSince Netflix still has to borrow aggressively to power its growth, the next logical question would be: what would stop other deep-pocketed rivals, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), from entering this lucrative arena?\\nThe only true barrier for competitors who want to enter the subscription-driven streaming video business is the need for intensive injections of capital. If you’re a long-term investor who's considering whether to buy and hold Netflix for the next five years, for instance, this is one of the most important metrics to consider before you put your investment dollars to work.\\nThe most successful long-term investments are in companies which have a wide economic moat. This means they have enough financial power to thwart competition. Netflix certainly lacks the financial muscle to do that right now. But when you look at the competitive landscape at the moment, no other company can even come close to what Netflix is offering subscribers.\\nAmazon’s Prime Video, which is part of its $119-a-year Prime shipping subscription in the US, is mostly used as an add-on to Netflix. Hulu, a joint venture between Disney (DIS), Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T), ultimately poses a serious threat because of its Hulu Live offering. Perhaps of more concern is that Hulu is supported by all the major networks, each with a studio of its own. But it's not yet global though it is offered to users in Japan as well as the US.\\nStill, Hulu, or a similar enterprise, may prove to be the biggest competitive threat Netflix may face since it will come from legacy media companies, such as Walt Disney, which earn billions and have the muscle to try joining forces in order to put together a product that could give subscribers a true alternative to Netflix.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nThere are a plenty of reasons to doubt that Netflix will be able to continue its success story. If you’re willing to bet on Netflix going forward, you have to be a firm believer that one day the company’s accelerating subscriber growth will produce cash flows that will both pay for its content spending while also producing massive bottom-line profit.\\nWe're believers. Netflix is perfectly positioned to make that happen. It has a first-mover advantage, ongoing global subscription expansion as well as gradual price increases. We think Netflix has built a dominant streaming and content franchise that’s going to be hard to match in the next five years.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAs has been discussed previously, for long-term investors looking to build wealth and boost retirement income, stocks that have a proven history of rewarding shareholders via dividends could be a key investment strategy. Unlike growth investing though, where quick appreciation of a stock's value as the company expands profits is the goal, a dividend-growth investor’s main focus would be reliable and reliably increasing payouts so that the value of the dividend checks keeps growing every year.\\nThe math on this is simple: suppose you bought a stock at $20 a share and in return receive a $1 annual dividend. The annual yield on your initial investment would be 5%. But if that payout is hiked by the company to $1.50 annually your yield—based on the cost of your $20 share purchase—is now 7.5%. If that annual payout continues to grow, reaching $2 a share your yield on cost would be a whopping 10%.\\nBecause the right dividend growth investment could be a powerful way to improve your returns over time, we recommend investing in companies that have a history of offering regular dividend increases on a sustained basis. As a rule, these companies run mature and stable businesses whose management has a long-term philosophy that involves caring about the company's reputation and rewarding loyal investors.\\nRegular dividend payouts can also signal a lot about a company’s ability to predict its own future. It would look very unprofessional, not to mention damaging, for management to hike dividends only to then cut them after a few quarters because cash flows had collapsed.\\nOur picks for strong dividend growth stocks? The two below hit all the right parameters.\\n1. Home Depot\\nHD Weekly\\nFor example, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is the largest home improvement retailer in the US. Shares of the stock, which closed yesterday at $169.82, are currently trading at the lower end of their 52 week range. And though its 2.44% dividend yield may not look too exciting, if you take into account the number of dividend hikes the company delivered during the past 10 years, the investment case changes.\\nHome Depot has paid dividends for the past 29 years, raising its payout by more than 350% over the last 10 years. Investors now get a quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, up from $0.225 a a decade ago.\\nPlus, Home Depot is expanding digital sales which is helping propel strong growth momentum for the retailer. With a manageable dividend payout ratio below 50%, you can expect continued dividend growth as well.\\n2. Procter & Gamble\\nPG Weekly\\nConsumer staple giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), is another example of a stock worth stashing in a buy-and-hold portfolio where it can sit quietly and earn growing payouts for an investor. P&G stock, which closed yesterday at $91.94 currently yields 3.1%. It has increased its payouts for 60 consecutive years, a track record few companies throughout the world can match.\\nThis consistent dividend growth also shows how powerful the company’s cash-flow generation is. Its product portfolio, which includes such globally recognized brands as Pampers diapers, Tide laundry detergent, and Charmin toilet paper, is strong enough to sustain revenue growth through wars, recessions and market downturns. And its payout ratio of 67.67 is healthy enough to ensure a continued growing income stream to investors. Over the past decade, its annual payout has doubled to $2.87 per share.\\nBottom Line\\nBuying dividend-growth stocks should be a critical component of your buy-and-hold investing strategy. Their steadily increasing payouts will help expand wealth while providing a hedge against economic uncertainty. In our view both Home Depot and Procter & Gamble fit the bill handsomely. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWhen Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports Q3 2018 earnings Tuesday, it has a lot to make its shareholders excited.\\nAnalysts, on average, expect 26% jump in fiscal third-quarter earnings to $1.95 a share on $15.34 billion in revenue.\\nDisney (DIS) 1-Year Chart\\nThe entertainment giant just concluded a $52.4 billion deal to acquire 21st Century Fox’s media assets, arming the House of Mouse with tons of ammunition to take on its rivals.\\nAfter a long bidding war with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Disney has no major hurdle left to cross before it takes over some of the Rupert Murdoch’s priciest assets, including Fox’s TV and film production studios that produced hits such as “Avatar” and “Deadpool,” as well as the National Geographic and FX networks. The deal will also raise Disney’s interest in video streaming service Hulu to 60%.\\nThe Fox deal was part of CEO Bob Iger’s strategy to arrest a slide in revenue at a time when Disney’s biggest revenue-generating units -- television and the ESPN sports network -- were losing viewers and advertising dollars to internet disruptors such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).\\nNow, investors are hopeful about Disney’s ability to defend its turf. With the addition of Fox's assets in the coming months, Disney will have a much stronger competitive advantage in film, television and theme parks to make up for the declining TV revenue.\\nThat optimism is reflected in Disney’s share price recently. It has gained 14% during the past two months, breaking out of a sluggish three years when it hardly budged.\\nDisney Rules Movies, But Needs A Strong Streaming Product\\nRight now, Disney dominates the box office. It has a 35% share of the domestic box office this year, helped by top releases such as “Black Panther” and “Incredibles 2,” according to a Bloomberg report.\\nDisney’s third-quarter numbers will likely be bolstered by these successes.\\nBut we think it’s still too early to expect a significant reversal at Disney’s media networks unit, which has been a major drag on its share price. The business still remains the company’s major breadwinner, accounting for about half of the company’s operating revenue. Disney’s successful conclusion to its Fox deal and its foray into the streaming video business are the two main growth drivers for this entertainment heavyweight.\\nThe biggest challenge for Disney is to package its diversified entertainment assets in a way that they could win viewers back from Netflix’s $11-a-month app. We might get some insight on this from the CEO Bob Iger when he speaks in a post-earning conference call. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nRecently, there\\'s hardly been a day when something negative about the social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) hasn\\'t made headlines. Last Friday it was a post from the company, revealing that a software bug gave outside developers broader access to the photos of millions of users.\\nEarlier this week it was another revelation about the Russian manipulation of the last US election via the platform, in a report commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The report said that Facebook-owned Instagram played a much bigger role than the company had previously admitted, giving an impression that the CEO and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, tried to downplay the utility of his site as one of the most prized assets for the Russian manipulators.\\nAnd just yesterday, the New York Times reported:\\n\\n\"For years, Facebook gave some of the world\\'s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users\\' personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules.\"\\n\\nIn short, the past 12 months have seen a growing mound of devastating news emerge about Facebook. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal, to repeated missteps on everything from violent extremism within Facebook’s internet walls to the departure of multiple senior executives, each event played a role in damaging the company’s reputation as one of the safest social platforms.\\nFB Weekly \\nThis continuous barrage of negative headlines over the past two quarters hasn\\'t helped the company’s stock recover from its deep slump. After all the upheaval technology shares faced in 2018, Facebook is emerging as the biggest loser within the FAANG group, which includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Facebook closed yesterday at $143.66, having plunged almost 21% from where it started at the beginning of the year, and off 34% its 52 week high.\\nThis huge underperformance is one major indicator that investors not only doubt the efficacy of Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership, they also remain leery of his ability to steer the company out of this mess. As well, they’re also anticipating the real possibility of tighter regulations by the US government. That would alter the company\\'s business model, which the social media giant used to create unprecedented wealth for itself and for millions of investors since its 2012 IPO.\\nChances Bleak For 2019 Turnaround\\nIn our view, the next two quarters will be crucial for Facebook. The company needs to show investors it has dealt with and moved past all the crises it faced during 2018. At its core the company still has enough financial firepower to outperform competitors.\\nBut if engineering a meaningful turnaround could be difficult, the bigger challenge for Zuckerberg will be how quickly he can restore investor confidence in his leadership and prove there are no additional negative surprises ahead. In our view, these big unknowns have damaged Facebook more than its slowing revenue.\\nAs we discussed in an article earlier this month, Facebook’s rival Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has done a much better job on this front. That\\'s been proven by how handsomely investors have rewarded Twitter for its openness even this highly uncertain environment for growth stocks.\\nOnce all the bad news is out of the way, we believe Facebook is in a much better position to recover and resume its growth trajectory, especially when it’s still running the world’s most popular social platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. That said, it’s tough to put together a bullish case for Facebook stock for 2019.\\nAs the company increases its spending to make its properties more acceptable to regulators, politicians and especially users, investors shouldn’t expect the kind of margins they once saw. The most profitable regions for Facebook—the US, Europe and Canada—are unlikely to see user growth in 2019. In Europe, a recently adopted digital privacy law is threatening to crimp growth, while the number of daily users of Facebook and its Messenger app have already plateaued in the US and Canada.\\nAs its old platforms mature in terms of user growth, Facebook is itself cautioning investors that new growth drivers, such as private messages on WhatsApp and Messenger, web videos on Facebook, and video-and-photo diaries called Stories on Instagram and Facebook, will take time to bring in sales at the rate which investors saw during the last boom.\\nBottom Line\\nThe increasing threat of government regulations, Facebook’s network weaknesses, and potentially slowing global growth are the three main risks to the company’s recovery in 2019. These factors are likely to keep the company’s near-term growth under pressure and further delay a stock price recovery. In this environment, we see Facebook shares remaining vulnerable to further weakness, at least during the first half of 2019. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOne of the most volatile earnings seasons in recent years is coming to an end. That's the good news.\\nThe bad news is that the results have clouded the market outlook rather than provided investors with some clarity about the future. Consider, for example the technology giants, the companies that were primarily responsible for fueling the unprecedented rally of the past decade. Most of these firms are clearly entering a slow patch and have failed to create excitement, just when the markets need it badly.\\nThe biggest economic growth engines—Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)—delivered earnings that were generally a mixed bag. What investors took away from those numbers were only promises for the future, with nothing concrete, as these companies shift their business models in order to come to terms with the new realities of the market, where preventing privacy breaches and political manipulation takes priority over anything else.\\nAmazon, the biggest online retailer, reported a second consecutive quarter of sales that fell short of estimates, while Alphabet’s third quarter sales missed analyst expectations, with revenue growth from its main Google sites, including Search and YouTube, coming in slower than the prior period.\\nAAPL Weekly\\nOne of the biggest disappointments in the technology space came from the most valuable company in the world by market cap, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). After the smartphone and media device manufacturer released earnings on November 1, then announced during its earnings call that it would stop disclosing iPhone sales data, its stock went into a steep decline, losing 7% immediately after the forward guidance was released.\\nOver the next two weeks, shares plummeted, falling more than 16%, reaching their lowest level since late June. The sell-off accelerated when a number of Apple suppliers cut their demand forecasts, clouding the demand outlook for the company’s flagship iPhone during the biggest holiday season of the year.\\nWorsening Macro Environment\\nThough the negative earnings surprises undoubtedly played a part in the sell-off of these marquee tech names, it’s hard to ignore the worsening macro environment and larger anxieties about growth and volatility that are forcing investors to look for safety.\\nEvidence of this trend came from the still thriving retail sector. Some of the nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD), saw their share prices pressured despite each having posted strong earnings and positive forward guidance for Q4.\\nDuring last week's earnings release, Walmart, the largest big-box retailer, reported a rise in quarterly sales and boosted its profit outlook for the year. Its online sales also surged, offering yet more clear proof that it's well on track to take on its main rival, Amazon.\\nThe company also continued to expand its click-and-collect services, which are now available at 2,100 stores, as well as grocery delivery, offered from 600 locations. These efforts pushed its online sales growth to more than 40% in the quarter. Nevertheless, Walmart shares slipped during the past week, losing about 6%.\\nBig Oil was one bright spot. Some of the biggest oil and gas producers, including Exxon Mobil (NYSE:NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) each delivered their strongest third quarter results in four years, showing profits not seen since the days of $100 crude.\\nBoth companies reported double-digit production increases in the Permian Basin, the shale region in Texas and New Mexico that’s propelling total US oil output to all-time highs. The Permian now makes up 11% of Chevron’s overall output and is home to Exxon’s fastest growing large project.\\nBottom Line\\nThe major takeaway from this earnings season: companies are facing cost pressures as wages and interest rates rise. That trend, combined with global growth worries and trade war anxieties, will make it very difficult for even healthy companies to produce stunning earning results going forward.\\nIn this environment of fear and uncertainty, there are a few areas of refuge—companies which are defensive, pay reliable dividends and perform well in market downturns. Three consumer staple sector sector stalwarts, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) are a few strong examples. Each could provide protection when little else seems to be working. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe beginning of 2019 has been stellar for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Despite investor pessimism weighing on the broader markets, shares of the streaming video giant have already surged almost 21% this year, surpassing all other high-growth tech stocks during the period.\\nNFLX 300 Minute Chart\\nMore significantly, the stock has gained 37% since it hit a bottom on December 24, after shedding about 43% of its value in the widespread de-risking that took place during the previous six months, a sweeping selloff that didn’t spare any of the marquee FAANGs.\\nThe magnitude of Netflix's rebound suggests investors firmly believe the equity was unfairly punished during this correction and the company’s strong fundamentals remain intact.\\nWhat makes Netflix different from other entertainment content delivery companies is its low pricing, aggressive content creation, and wide global appeal. These three factors should keep investors comfortable about continuing to bet on this streaming giant, even though the macro environment is no longer favorable for high-growth stocks.\\nThe latest example of this dominance comes from the mid-December release of “Bird Box.” The horror movie, starring Sandra Bullock, has become so popular it's now a cultural and social-media phenomenon. Indeed, Netflix rarely releases data on viewership of its content, but in the case of “Bird Box,” a tale about a resourceful mother protecting children from a homicidal force, the company said a record-setting 45.3 million of its 137 million accounts watched at least 70% of the movie in the first week of its release.\\nAnother Netflix December release, the Mexican drama “Roma,” won two Golden Globes on Sunday, including best foreign-language picture and best director. The victory helped boost shares on Monday. The film is also considered to be a strong contender in the best foreign film Oscar race.\\nDiminishing Bear Case\\nIn our view, successes like these diminish the bear case against Netflix, a narrative that was based on the company’s massive outlay for marketing and content. Netflix bears argue that the company’s content spending—which will reach an estimated $12 billion during the past year—simply isn't sustainable. And if the economy turns sour and credit markets tighten, it may become tough for Netflix to finance its ambitious content budget.\\nBut the world’s largest online pay-TV network has so far defied these expectations. It continues to add subscribers at a pace that even surprises many of its most bullish fans.\\nIn the the third quarter, Netflix added far more subscribers than analysts expected and issued an upbeat outlook for the three months ended in December. It forecast adding 28.9 million customers in total this year, which would be a record for the 21-year-old company.\\nIn our view, Netflix is among the few tech stocks that can weather a prolonged downturn and emerge stronger. The primary reason for our optimism is the company’s success at attracting increasing numbers of subscribers globally, in a variety of regional markets where the company is still in early stages of expansion.\\nNetflix’s strategy for global expansion provides lots of room for growth. In the third quarter, 84% of Netflix's subscriber growth came from areas, such as Brazil, the UK, Canada, and India. Though Netflix is facing cost pressures and some saturation in its US home market, the global opportunity in streaming video is so big, the company has a long runway before they might see peak growth in regions outside the US.\\nAs well, by flooding the market with new titles, Netflix is able to target all age groups, making it hard for viewers to go elsewhere. In Q3 2018 the streaming video provider released a breathtaking 676 hours of original programming. Even better, there's no sign that Netflix has reached a ceiling on that metric.\\nTrading at $320.27 as of yesterday's close, we see a lot of upside, especially if the company delivers another blow-out quarterly earnings report, scheduled for Thursday January 17, after the close. According to analysts’ consensus 12-month price target, the stock still has a 25% upside potential from its current level.\\nBottom Line\\nDue to its low cost—the standard monthly subscription runs from $10.99 per month—superior technology and the depth of its content offering, there is no competitor that can pose a serious challenge to Netflix anytime soon. That makes the stock a superb pick for anyone looking to add a quality technology growth stock to their portfolio while also taking advantage of the recent slump. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

After consistently beating analyst expectations for many years now, it seems Walmart (NYSE:WMT) won't be able to please investors with anything but the extraordinary.\\nWMT Weekly 2017-2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn its first-quarter, Walmart reported that comparable sales at its U.S. businesses rose 3.4% from a year earlier, its strongest performance on that metric for the period in nine years, helped by increasing market share and growth in online sales, even as competitors struggled.\\nInvestors will once again be closely monitoring these two performance indicators tomorrow—same-store sales and online expansion. Their performance explains how successfully Walmart is competing with online behemoth Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and will illustrate as well how the Bentonville, AR-based retailer's massive brick-and-mortar presence helps.\\nThe good news is that there is little reason for Walmart investors to worry. Over multiple previous quarters, Walmart has proven that its huge brick-and-mortar presence gives it an advantage no other online competitor can match.\\nDuring that period, Walmart has also significantly cut spending on new store construction, in favor of growing its online presence, lowering prices and adding more services in physical stores such as online grocery pickup. To compete with Amazon’s one-day delivery feature, the retailer has started offering free, nationwide one-day shipping on thousands of household goods. It expects to be able to reach 40% of U.S. households with grocery delivery by the end of this year.\\nThe company is quickly expanding its click-and-collect services. The option is currently in 2,450 U.S. stores after adding about 1,000 grocery pickup locations just last year. That’s a serious challenge to Amazon, which offers pickup from Whole Foods in 22 cities.\\nStrong Consumer Sentiment Also Helping\\nEven as its online strategy has succeeded in fueling growth, enhanced consumer sentiment is also helping keep customer traffic strong. Gains last quarter on this metric reflected both an increase in traffic as well as shoppers spending more per transaction. As well, there are signs that this trend will persist—at least for the remainder of this year.\\nConsumer sentiment in the U.S. held steady in July, near historically elevated levels. At the same time expectations improved in the later part of the month as a strong labor market helped to offset worries about slower global growth and trade tensions, according to Bloomberg, citing the University of Michigan's sentiment index.\\nAside from its traditional strength in retail, Walmart is also pursuing other growth opportunities to diversify its revenue base. For example, it's building a digital-advertising business that uses data from both store purchases and visits to its website to help brands target a specific audience.\\nOne danger to this promising outlook, which has started to weigh on its share price, $107is the lingering U.S.-China trade war. Ongoing tensions might force the retailer to increase prices on items it imports from China. These concerns have sparked a sell-off in Walmart shares, which are trading at $107.43 as of yesterday's close. The stock has slipped more than 6% over the past one month.\\nBottom Line\\nAfter a remarkable rally since its December low, Walmart shares may look expensive. That concern, in our view, ignores the fact the retailer isn’t the same company it was five years ago. With its e-commerce momentum and strong core brick-and-mortar operations, we believe the stock has more room to run. In our view, any post earnings weakness should be seen as a buying opportunity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The second largest global oil producer behind Exxon Mobil (NYSE:NYSE:XOM), Chevron boasts integrated operations with both upstream and downstream exposure as well as a separate petrochemical division.\\nCVX Weekly 2015-2018\\nThis diversified business model offers a great hedge against falling oil prices. Even if the company loses money on production of oil and gas, its energy product refining and commodity petrochemical businesses can still generate cash, mitigating the impact of an oil market slump.\\nIn its third quarter earnings report, released last month, Chevron reported profits had doubled when compared to the same period a year ago, beating analyst forecasts. We believe the company will accelerate its share repurchase plan if the oil markets remain depressed in 2019.\\nThat’s the reason that analysts remain bullish on this stock which has a higher analyst percentage buy rating than competitors such as BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) and Total (NYSE:TOT). It's almost 68%, with no sell recommendations, according to Bloomberg data.\\nThe company currently pays a $4.48 per share annual dividend, which amounts to a 3.88% yield at the stocks current share price of $115.62. The dividend has nearly doubled during the past decade and has a reasonable payout ratio of 69.\\nChevron is currently focusing on returning cash to investors with its $25-billion share buyback plan. CEO Michael Wirth told the Financial Times in mid-2018 that he wants the company to be able to cover its dividend with free cash flow at $50 oil.\\n2. ConocoPhillips: A Defensive Play\\nIf you believe that this sluggish spell in oil markets is temporary and the market will rebound once the US and China resolve their trade dispute, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) would be one of the best oil giants to have in your portfolio.\\nCOP Weekly 2015-2018\\nDuring the past three years, the company has successfully pursued a turnaround strategy that focused on sustained cost-cutting while returning cash to investors. After a major portfolio re-balancing—which focused on shedding high-cost assets—Conoco has become cash flow positive with the price of oil above $40 a barrel. That low oil price breakeven level positions the company to survive, even if oil markets remain subdued in 2019.\\nThe Houston-based producer plans to continue with this defensive approach. During its third quarter report in October, Conoco raised its full-year spending estimate by a meager 1.7% to $6.1 billion. During the third quarter, the company handed almost $1 billion back to shareholders, part of its $9 billion share buyback plan announced in July.\\nFor 2019, Conoco expects capital spending to be roughly in-line with its current drilling budget. After years of cost-cutting and efficiency gains following the oil market price collapse, Conoco’s profits are back where they were in 2014, when Brent was selling for closer to $100 a barrel.\\nBottom Line\\nThe current oil market slump is a good reminder that a short-term approach doesn’t work when it comes to investing in oil stocks. In our view, picking solid income-focused oil equities for the longer run is the better approach to hedging against extreme oil volatility. For buy-and-hold investors both Chevron and Conoco fit that bill. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAfter last week’s earnings disappointments from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the two tech giants that investors were hoping would provide some solid support in this volatile market, hope—if there's any left—has shifted to a broader theme, managing the market's growing downside risk.\\nIn this environment of uncertainty and fear, both the Dow and the S&P 500 have already wiped out this year's gains. The NASDAQ is the only one of the US major indices still holding on to any gains, year-to-date the tech heavy index remains up 3.3%.\\nDuring another week packed with earnings announcements, these three names are perhaps the most important. They could provide investors with some sense of the market's future direction .\\n1. Apple\\nThe world’s most valuable company by market cap is scheduled to report fiscal Q4 2018 earnings on Thursday, November 1, after the market closes. In an environment when high growth tech giants are being punished for growth that's slowing, this Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may provide a breath of fresh air.\\nApple Weekly 2015-2018\\nThe main point of focus for investors will be the legacy tech company’s projections for the sale of its new iPhone series: XS, XS Max, and XR. A bullish demand forecast for the important holiday season, which is just round the corner, is likely to push Apple shares, which closed Friday at $216, out of their current bearish spell.\\nStill, over the longer term Apple is facing similar challenges to those that are keeping a lid on growth for other tech companies. An escalating trade war may hinder the company’s growth prospects in China, the world’s largest market for smartphones. It can also increase prices for American consumers, something the company has already warned about. The key test for Apple will be whether it can continue to juice more profit in a market where users aren’t too keen on flipping their phones quickly. As well, the question will be how fast can it diversify its revenue base.\\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to generate earnings per share of $2.78 for the September quarter, up from $2.07 a year earlier. These analysts also forecast that Apple will increase sales to $61.4 billion from the $52.6 billion it posted in sales a year ago.\\n2. Facebook\\nFacebook Inc.’s (NASDAQ:FB) third quarter earnings report will be released on Tuesday, October 30 after the market close. It's one of the most keenly awaited events of the week.\\nFB Weekly 2015-2018\\nThe social media giant is struggling to overcome challenges it’s facing after a series of data breaches including the Cambridge Analytica scandal which broke in early March, along with intense public and political scrutiny over the past year.\\nSince its disappointing previous earnings report in July, which missed revenue targets and showed slower-than-expected user growth and heavier spending to increase the security of Facebook's social network and free it from political manipulation, FB's stock has been severely punished, losing more than quarter of its value.\\nDuring this week's earnings report, embattled CEO Mark Zuckerberg must show investors how quickly he can fix the social media giant's problems without endangering the company’s super growth cycle. On average, analysts polled by FactSet, expect earnings of $1.46 a share, down from $1.59 during the same quarter a year ago, on $13.77 billion of sales.\\n3. Coca-Cola\\nSeparate from tech and social media concerns, soft drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is also scheduled to Q3 2018 earnings on Tuesday October 30 before the market opens.\\nKO Weekly 2015-2018\\nFresh off the $5.1-billion acquisition of UK-based Costa Coffee chain, the world’s largest beverage company is likely to provide investors with further insight on how its entry into the hot beverage category will boost sales as consumers continue to shun sugary sodas. That headwind is so strong, it’s rattling many established brands and slowing sales growth in the category.\\nOver the past few years, Coke has been working to reduce the amount of sugar in its flagship drinks. It's also been adding a variety of low- and no-sugar alternatives, including soy-based beverages, teas, waters and juices, as a way to revive sales that have been sliding since 2012.\\nFor the third quarter, which ended in September, analysts on average expect Coke to report $0.55 a share profit, up from $0.5 a share a year ago, on sales of $8.17 billion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nReports Tuesday, May 8, after the close\\nRevenue Expectation: $14.11B, EPS: $1.7\\n\\nWhen Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) reports Q2 2018 earnings later today, don’t expect a huge surprise. However, if you focus on the company\\'s longer-term future, there are a number of reasons to get excited about this global entertainment giant, which has been building a war chest, arming itself to take on its rivals.\\nDisney’s biggest revenue-generating unit, media and networks—which includes television and the ESPN sports network—has been going through a rough patch. It lost viewers and advertising dollars to internet disruptors such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger is addressing these challenges with some bold moves, including his plans for new online services and a $52.4 billion deal, announced in December, to buy much of 21st Century Fox Inc. (NASDAQ:FOX).\\nThere might be a spanner in the works, though. Earlier today, Reuters reported that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is considering a hostile play to break up the deal and has lined up around $60 billion in financing, in order to make an all-cash offer for Fox\\'s assets. According to the Wall Street Journal, \"Comcast hasn\\'t yet decided whether to proceed with the hostile bid.\"\\nThis new development notwithstanding, Disney will likely stay the course on addressing its challenges—and its competition. Last month, ESPN launched a subscription-based streaming service ESPN+, Disney’s first big push into the digital arena since it took a majority stake in technology company BAMtech last year. The service, which costs $4.99 per month, features thousands of live games, on-demand sports content and some exclusive content, designed to augment its struggling ESPN network.\\nDIS Weekly \\nThough Comcast\\'s latest move could weigh on Disney shares in the near term, any positive surprise on the subscriber or advertising fronts should be good enough to fuel some gains in Disney\\'s stock, which yesterday closed at $102.48. The price has been rising ahead of today\\'s earnings report, after falling as much as 8% this year. Investors will be keenly watching the number of subscribers that have signed up for this latest addition to the company\\'s growing streaming family.\\nNo Major Turnaround...Yet\\nNevertheless, we think it’s still too early to expect a significant reversal at Disney’s media networks unit, which has been a major drag on its share price. Less than a decade ago, ESPN was available in about 99 million homes in the U.S., but that number has fallen to about 87 million homes, according to Nielsen data.\\nDespite the declining audience, this business remains the House of Mouse\\'s major breadwinner. It accounts for about half of the company’s operating revenue. In the last quarter, operating income from this business declined by 12%, to $1.2 billion—its seventh consecutive quarterly drop.\\nHowever, there are also some very bright spots on the short-term horizon: Disney\\'s Marvel and Star Wars franchises have been producing robust sales results. The latest data show Disney\\'s “Avengers: Infinity War” film, released in the US on April 23rd, crushed sales expectations during the past two weeks, topping $1 billion in global ticket sales, while “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” scheduled for release at the end of May, is expected to have an opening weekend of $160-$170 million.\\nBottom Line\\nDuring the past few quarters, Disney has been successful in beating analysts’ expectations. It might very well do the same today.\\nStill, we don’t think this report will be enough to break the sluggishness cycle for Disney stock. We think Disney needs an early, and now successful conclusion to its Fox deal. If the acquisition goes through, it will be a major driver of future growth for the entertainment heavyweight, supporting the company\\'s foray into online streaming business in a big way. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) just showed investors the one thing they didn\\'t want to see from a technology company in the middle of a turnaround: shrinking sales.\\nWeekly IBM Chart\\nBefore IBM reported its third quarter earnings on Tuesday, expectations were that the Big Blue had arrested a six-year decline in its sales and that its new growth engine—cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and network security—was strong enough to keep that momentum going.\\nBut the third quarter numbers told a different story. IBM is still struggling to break away from its past when its legacy mainframes (the gigantic computers that help large global companies to process complex IT data) propelled growth.\\nIBM reported that Q3 revenue fell 2.1% to $18.8 billion, disappointing analysts who were expecting $19.1 billion. Cloud revenue, which has become a key metric to watch, grew 10% in the period to $4.5 billion, half the 20% expansion in the second quarter. The \"Cognitive Solutions\" segment of the business, which includes artificial intelligence and the Watson supercomputer also saw revenue decline significantly, about 5% year over year.\\nInvestors were displeased with the company\\'s performance, sending IBM shares down the most in four years and dashing hopes of a quick recovery in its shares which are currently trading at $130.55. In our view, belief in the IBM turnaround is a losing bet. The reason is simple. IBM has tough competitors in the new economy who are grabbing the major share of new growth areas that are so crucial to the company’s success.\\nIBM, which dominated the early decades of computing with inventions like the mainframe and the floppy disk, is no longer an innovative company and barely poses a major challenge to today’s tech giants, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\\nEven after years of massive investments in acquisitions, infrastructure, and re-structuring, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has failed to produce steady growth in the business unit that includes cloud and artificial intelligence.\\nIn the cloud computing market, for example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the global market leader at 33%, followed by Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 13% and Google Cloud Platform with 6% share, according to Synergy Research Group.\\nWarren Buffett, once one of IBM\\'s biggest investors, has dumped almost all of his holdings in the company through his investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:NYSE:BRKa).\\n\"I don\\'t value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying,\" he told CNBC last year. \"I think if you look back at what they were projecting and how they thought the business would develop, I would say what they\\'ve run into is some pretty tough competitors.\"\\nIf IBM isn’t going to be a winner in the new economy, is there any reason to still buy the stock? One possible attraction is its hefty dividend yield that’s touching 5% after the stock’s massive beating during the past five years.\\nBut the stability of that payout is also questionable as it largely depends on the company’s turnaround success. Its mainframe business, a cash cow that’s slowly drying up, can’t support that income stream. At a time when companies are fast migrating towards the cloud, the utility of its mainframe servers is rapidly fading.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nIBM’s performance in the past few quarters shows that it can’t generate consistent growth across its portfolio. We think there are much better income and growth opportunities available in the market. We see no value in sticking with IBM and waiting for a turnaround that may never come. IBM is a losing bet that smart investors should avoid. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nMarkets don’t move in a straight line. This is a simple concept that should be understand when you become a long-term investor. But the extreme volatility we’re seeing these days is enough to spook many investors, especially those who've grown used to VIX complacency.\\nIn an environment of confusion and fear, some investors forget the actual reason that led them to buy a stock in the first place. Such investors usually sell their best holdings at the first sign of danger, often for no good reason.\\nThe current, ongoing correction, which wiped out about $4 trillion from global markets during the past week, is a manifestation of this herd mentality. And this time, the declines have nothing to do with the fundamentals of the economy and businesses.\\nSo, if this is a blip in your long journey in the world of investing, how should you benefit from the current environment? Smart investors usually buy more of the stuff they like when the prices become more appealing. In the U.S. technology space, I like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:NFLX).\\nThese stocks have had a pretty amazing run during the past year, simply because each has a fantastic business model, something that's hard to replicate. And I don’t see the momentum of either slowing down anytime soon. Here is why:\\nFacebook\\nFB Weekly 2016-2018\\nIf your investment philosophy is buy-and-hold, then you shouldn’t even think about selling Facebook stock in this market rout. Facebook is still one of the best growth stories in the tech world despite the recent investor nervousness about the company’s changing tactics on how it is letting users consume news.\\nFacebook combines some of the best qualities of an internet-era company. Its sales are growing at an impressive double-digit rate; it also has one of the best margins on each dollar earned. As for future growth, it has many untapped avenues, such as WhatsApp.\\nIn the most recent quarter, Facebook sales rose 47% from a year earlier. You don’t see a company of Facebook's size regularly boost sales at this pace. Only a handful of global companies are growing more quickly than Facebook.\\nAlong with expanding sales, Facebook also generated industry-beating profit margins. For each dollar of revenue, it makes $0.46 of operating profit. That's a performance that remains nothing more than a dream for many industry executives.\\nThis impressive Q4 performance occurred despite Facebook's slowing advertising sales growth. But the latest earnings show that Facebook is capable of making up the difference thanks to the power of its platform, for which advertisers are willing to pay higher fees.\\nDuring the past five trading days, Facebook stock has shed about 5% of its value. As of yesterday's close it's trading at $180.18.\\nStill, this is the company which delivered more than 500% gains to shareholders during the past five years, far exceeding broader market returns. I would buy more shares of Facebook on weakness if I have cash sitting on the sidelines.\\n\\nNetflix\\nNFLX Weekly 2017-2018\\nThe world’s largest online TV network, Netflix, is another example of a stock worth buying during times of market distress.\\nThe company last month reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date. The performance was good enough to put Netflix into the fairly exclusive club of $100-billion companies by market cap after shares of the stock, currently trading at $265 after yesterday's close, almost doubled in value during the past year.\\nThe power of the Netflix brand was tested during the recent market meltdown. The results were gratifying for shareholders as well as wannabes. Netflix outperformed many tech giants and remained strong.\\nIn the most recent quarter, Netflix reported a record 8.3 million new subscribers, well above its previous guidance of 6.3 million. But Netflix's growth is not even close to peaking, especially when the company is getting a strong response internationally. Encouraged by the increasing demand for its content, Netflix plans to spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and another $2 billion for marketing.\\nThere is no doubt that Netflix will face tough competition from some of the largest global entertainment companies such as Disney (NYSE:DIS), which plans to pour billions of dollars into streaming video content to grab some additional market share. Nevertheless, I see Netflix as well positioned to survive this onslaught.\\nNetflix has a great competitive advantage, including a valuable trove of user data that it can leverage to further monetize its customer base.\\nThe bottom line: The way I see it, buying stocks is just like becoming a long-term partner in a business you like that you believe will continue growing. Both Facebook and Netflix are great growth stocks which should be kept in your buy-and-hold portfolio.\\nIf you have extra cash on the sidelines it wouldn't be a bad strategy to add both to your positions, if you see some additional pullback in these stocks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nU.S. markets are going through an uncertain phase right now, as last week's hightened volatility showed. As such, it’s hard to predict what lies ahead. \\nStocks recovered some losses over the past two trading sessions, after President Donald Trump announced a delay in some of his latest tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump also said Thursday that discussions are ongoing with China, and that he expects to talk to President Xi Jinping soon.\\nBut that positive signal failed to erase the earlier losses that the market suffered after a strong sell signal from the bond market. The S&P 500 ended the week down 1%, while the Dow lost 1.5% for the week. Amid this risk averse environment, there are still some big earning announcements ahead during the coming week, from different sectors of the economy. We are keeping a close eye on the following three stocks:\\n1.  Target  \\nBig-box retailer, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) will report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 21, before the market opens. Riding on the strength of consumer spending, Target is expected to report $1.62 a share net profit, up from $1.47 for the same quarter a year ago. Sales are likely to show an increase of 4% to $18.3 billion in the quarter, according to analysts’ average estimates. Following a strong showing this earnings season by some retail peers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target is unlikely to disappoint investors.\\nTGT Weekly\\nIn Q1, Target reported very strong growth in comparable sales, which rose 4.8%, beating analysts’ estimates.On a call with analysts in May, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith, however, dampened expectations by saying that Target’s comparable sales in Q2 will be “somewhat slower” than the previous three months as the benefit from the closures of Toys “R” Us stores slows down. Target's shares, trading at $84.20 as of Friday's close, have outperformed rivals this year, rising 30% in 2019.\\n2. Salesforce.com\\nSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which sells software and cloud-based services to corporate clients, will report its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Aug. 22, after the market close. On average, analysts expect $0.47 a share profit, while sales are likely to jump 20% to $3.95 billion, helped by a global surge in technology spending.\\nDespite the company’s impressive record of producing blow-out quarters, its shares have come under pressure since the San Francisco-based customer relationship management firm announced in June that it’s acquiring software maker  Tableau Software  (NYSE:DATA) for $15.3 billion. \\nCRM Weekly TTM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe all-stock deal was Salesforce’s largest transaction ever as part of its move to expand into the business intelligence market. According to the company, the Tableau deal will boost sales this year and bring the company further into competition with software giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), both of which offer business intelligence tools.\\nSalesforce shares have lagged the broader market, falling 9% in the past three months. The stock closed on Friday at $143.95.\\n3. Home Depot\\nThe hardware and household improvement chain,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), will be reporting second quarter earnings on Tuesday, Aug. 20 before the open. On average, analysts expect $3.09 a share profit on sales of $31.06  billion.\\nThe world's largest home improvement chain has pursued a variety of successful strategies during the past few years to fuel growth and benefit from strong consumer spending. In the first quarter, however, Home Depot failed to impress investors when the same-store sales—a key gauge of a retailer’s success—rose 2.5%, trailing estimates of 4.3%.\\nHD Weekly TTM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a remarkable run over the past five years, during which Home Depot) shares—which closed on Friday at $203.64—gained more than 143%, the stock has weakened in the past month, hurt by worries about the economy and the trade tension with China.\\nHome Depot's winning streak may continue if falling U.S. mortgage rates help fuel home sales and renovation spending. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nReports Q2 2019 results on Friday, July 26, before the open\\nRevenue expectation: $828.9 million\\nEPS expectation: $0.18\\n\\nIf the recent past offers any clue, then Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) is well set to produce another strong quarter when it reports Q2 earnings tomorrow.\\nAfter the sustained turnaround efforts of the past year, the company has achieved financial stability. Its sales from advertising rose 18% in Q1, the fifth consecutive period of improvements.\\nTwitter price chart\\nOn the spending side, Twitter showed that it can meaningfully cut costs in an era when social media giants are constantly under pressure to do more to protect their networks from manipulations. The end result is that profitability is improving.\\nAccording to analysts’ consensus estimates, Twitter is likely to show a 17% jump year-on-year in sales in 2Q to $829 million. Twitter likely earned an adjusted $0.18 a share profit in the period, compared with the $0.17 it produced in the year-ago period.\\nAs the recovery takes hold, investors are also becoming comfortable owning Twitter stock: it's gained more than 30% this year to trade at $38.73 at yesterday's close.\\nWhat’s impressive about Twitter’s turnaround is that the company has been able to show that with a smaller base of daily-active users, it can still build a sustainable business which investors can trust in this highly dynamic environment for social media companies.\\nIn a latest development, media reported this week that the U.S. Justice Department is opening a broad antitrust review into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition, adding a new layer of uncertainty for social media companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\\nTwitter’s Clean-Up Drives Success\\nIt’s unclear whether Twitter will be included in this probe, but what makes us more confident about the micro-blogging site is that its CEO Jack Dorsey has been quite successful in his efforts to rid the site of toxic content amid strong criticism that social media companies have failed to curb the exploitation of personal data, election meddling and hateful posts.\\nAccording to Twitter, about 38% of abusive content on the site is now being detected through technology and flagged for human review, up from none last year. These efforts have also restored advertisers’ confidence who now see Twitter as a valuable platform to reach their audience. In the last quarter, Twitter posted a jump in monetizable daily active users to 134 million, beating analysts' forecasts for about 128.4 million.\\nTo further improve user engagement and entice advertisers, Twitter is focusing more on video-content partnerships with the large media companies and brands. It has recently overhauled both the camera function and desktop site. The company has also rolled out a Snapchat-like camera feature that lets users post videos or photos in a swipe.\\nBottom Line\\nEven after a powerful rally this year, Twitter shares are still only about halfway to their all-time high of $74.73 reached in December 2013. In order to continue this upward move, we think Twitter has to show sustained revenue growth with an improvement in user metrics. We think the company has achieved solid momentum in turning its platform into one that advertisers increasingly value. Any post-earnings weakness should be a buying opportunity for those looking for a good entry point. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nQ3 2018 earnings have confirmed investors' worst fears for the world’s largest chip makers: the demand slowdown is more widespread and enduring than what was earlier communicated by industry executives. The most recent quarterly reports from some of the sector's highest flyers show that producers are facing cyclical headwinds which will continue to pressure their share valuations.\\nThe biggest sign of this pronounced slowdown came from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), which has the largest number of customers and the broadest product range in the chip industry. The Dallas-based company warned that demand is slowing across many of its markets, predicting its biggest sequential decline in revenue since 2012.\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards, followed with their own disappointing sales forecasts.\\nAfter the cryptocurrency market crash, which, until early this year fueled demand for chip makers' product, some top producers are predicting a bleaker future. This comes at a time when rising interest rates and the escalating trade war between the world’s largest economies—China and the US—are adding to uncertainty and cost pressures.\\nIndeed, China buys more computer chips than any other country, consuming about $140 billion, or 38%, of the world's semiconductors, according to research firm IC Insights. The US, on the other hand, is home to the largest chip makers, which leaves the industry exposed to tariffs and other trade barriers.\\nChip Stocks Bloodbath to Continue\\nThe worsening macro environment, cyclical downturn, and gloomy earnings season have all precipitated in pummeling semiconductor shares. Plus, there's no sign the bottom has been reached as yet.\\nHardest hit are such companies as Nvidia and Advanced Micro, which were exposed to the crypto-mania demand, a segment that dried up after digital currency valuations crashed.\\nShares of Nvidia have fallen more than 36% during the past six months, while AMD has lost about half of its value since reaching its 52-week high in September. After two years of more than 30% gains, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the industry benchmark, is down almost 6% for 2018.\\nIt’s difficult to predict when this weakness will pass, but amid the gloom investors shouldn’t ignore where the underlying strength within the industry resides. In our view, the new sources of demand—such as artificial intelligence, the rise of cloud computing and the world’s obsession with video games—are unlikely to dry up anytime soon.\\nThat said, we believe the time isn’t ripe to buy chip stocks. It’s better to stay on the sidelines until the macro environment improves and demand dynamics become more clear. Both AMD and Nvidia are particularly vulnerable to further weakness, driven by their excess inventories for gaming GPUs and collapse of crypto mining sales.\\nHowever, if you’re looking for the right moment to make a contrarian bet on the sector, we believe Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Texas Instruments are better positioned to weather this storm.\\nINTC Weekly 2015-2018\\nIn the third quarter, Intel not only beat sales and earnings estimates, the company also raised its full-year guidance. Intel is planning to spend around $1.5 billion more on capex this year than it originally expected. The company's forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10.5 also makes it one of the cheapest picks in the sector. The stock closed yesterday at $48.\\nTXN Weekly 2015-2018\\nTexas Instruments’ strength comes from its diverse line of products. Its chips perform the fundamental task of translating real-world inputs, such as sounds and touch, into electronic signals. This makes the company less vulnerable to sudden demand swings or competitive pressure. In 2017, 54% of TI’s revenue came from automotive and industrial applications.\\nBottom Line\\nThe chip stock sell-off is likely to continue until there's some improvement in the overall macro environment, especially in US-China trade relations. Both Intel and Texas Instruments are selling below the highs made earlier this year. In early 2018 TI hit a high of $119; the stock closed yesterday at $94.62, putting it 20% below where it started the year. Intel hit $57.60 in May, but, as of last night's close is now down almost 17% from that level.\\nBoth stocks attractive picks based on the current dip or any further weakness due to their compelling valuations and superior market positioning. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nAfter an impressive rally, the shares of General Mills (NYSE:GIS) are coming under pressure after the food giant’s fourth-quarter earnings report that gave mixed signals about the company’s future growth. And, in our view, bulls have a valid reason to get confused.\\nThe challenge for the maker of Cheerios Honey Nut cereal, Yoplait yogurt and Nature Valley granola is quite daunting: It has to accelerate growth in an era when consumers are rapidly changing their eating habits, looking for fresher, greener and less sugary food.\\nThe company’s Q4 earnings show the path ahead is likely to be uneven despite General Mills’ latest effort to diversify its revenue base. Investors sent the company’s shares tumbling 4.5% on Wednesday after it reported that sales—excluding the effects from currency fluctuations and acquisitions—fell in its fiscal fourth quarter and were flat for the year. The stock recouped some of those losses yesterday, rising 1.8% to close at $52.22.\\nThe company’s North America business, its largest, was the main contributor to 4Q\\'s sluggishness, with the unit’s sales falling 2% to $2.34 billion. Sales of cereals, yogurt and meals and baking items were flat, the company said. Snack sales declined as Fiber One bars and Nature Valley granola bars lost grounds.\\nDashed Hopes\\nBefore this weak performance, investors were generally excited about GM, as evident from the stock’s 40% rise this year, on hopes that last year’s acquisition of the maker of Blue Buffalo pet food, its largest deal in 18 years, would add a new growth avenue to the company’s portfolio at a time when its traditional food unit is under pressure.\\nGeneral Mills price chart\\nCEO Jeff Harmening, who is steering the company in this challenging environment for packaged food producers, tried to accelerate growth by rolling out trendy items, such as cereal that uses a wild grain related to wheat and new variations of its other popular cereal brands.\\nBut some analysts now believe that the positive impact of these efforts is already baked into the stock price, which is trading close to its 52-week high, and future gains will depend on the company’s innovations and its ability to fight disruptors such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is investing heavily to grab the major share of consumer grocery spending through its Whole Foods brand.\\nGoldman Sachs analyst Jason English downgraded the stock in May, predicting an inevitable slowdown following improvement in the company\\'s core business and the impact of its acquisition of Blue Buffalo.\\nGeneral Mills is entering a \"second chapter of mounting deceleration concerns among investors,\" English said in a note to clients, noting the ﬁrst chapter of enthusiasm has now \"largely played out.\" He also reduced his price target to $41 a share.\\nFor the fiscal year ending in 2020, the company guided investors to expect organic sales growth of 1-2%, but much of this will come from Blue Buffalo, which it projects will grow by 8-10%. Part of this growth will come from its legacy categories, helped by some uptick in snack bar volumes, the company said.\\nBottom Line\\nEven with the powerful 2019 rally, General Mills stock is down about 30% from its 2016 peak. There are clear signs that the surge that followed the Blue Buffalo acquisition is losing steam and investors are again zeroing in on General Mills\\' legacy businesses amid growing pressure from upstart competitors. That being said, the investments the company has made to accelerate growth have positioned it to perform better than its peers in this downturn for processed food stocks.\\nFor those who have an eye on the company’s 3.5% dividend yield, there will likely be a better entry point to buy this stock. For now, we don’t find the valuation compelling enough, especially as the management hasn\\'t demonstrated any new growth catalysts. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

He plans to go ahead with the latest duties despite his attempt to restart talks with Beijing to resolve the trade war, according to media reports.\\nThe threat of a full-blown trade war between the world’s largest economies will continue to weigh on investors this coming week. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said last week the $200 billion round of tariffs could hit some of its most popular goods such as the Apple Watch and AirPod headphones. Retailers such as WalMart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) may also see their cost of goods purchased from China escalating if further tariffs hit consumer goods.\\nBeyond trade wars, the coming week will feature earnings reports from some of the key areas of the market. Below are three closely watched stocks—a major shipper, significant chip manufacturer and software giant—that might go through big swings following their earnings releases in the days ahead:\\nFedEx: Swelling Deliveries, Robust US Economy\\nOn Monday, September 17, after the close, FedEx (NYSE:NYSE:FDX) is expected to report earnings for the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx's Q1 2018. According to Reuters’ forecasts, the shipping giant will report $3.11 a share profit for the first quarter, a gain of 24% when compared to the same period a year ago.\\nFDX Weekly 2015-2018\\nSwelling e-commerce deliveries and a robust US economy that’s driving demand in its freight-hauling business are helping Memphis,Tennessee-based FedEx, which has invested heavily to catch up with the online orders. Its past three earning reports have shown that that investments have started to pay off.\\nTrading at $255.44, FedEx shares have gained 19% during the past one year. Analysts have $286 a share consensus price target for the next 12 months.\\nThe company forecast earnings of $17 to $17.60 a share for the fiscal year that’s ending next May, excluding pension adjustments and costs from the integration of its purchase of international courier delivery service TNT Express, whose acquisition was completed in mid-2016. The midpoint of the forecast would represent a 13% gain on adjusted earnings for the year that ended May 31.\\nMicron Technology: Chip Demand Could Be Slowing\\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) will report its Q4 2018 earnings on Thursday, September 20 after the market close for the quarter that ended in August. According to the analyst consensus estimate compiled by Reuters, the chipmaker will report $3.14 a share profit for the fiscal fourth-quarter, up $2.02 from a year ago.\\nMU Weekly 2015-2018\\nAnalysts are divided on the future growth prospects for the largest US maker of memory chips amid signs that chip demand is slowing. Shares of this Boise, Idaho-based company have lost about 30% of their value during the past three months as analysts, including Morgan Stanley, said the memory chip market is deteriorating versus expectations.\\nThe past quarter may help clear this uncertainty for the company. Shares, which closed at $44.30 on Friday, and are considered undervalued by the company, had announced $10-billion buyback plan in May.\\nOracle: Struggling To Catch Up To Cloud Rivals\\nIn all likelihood, the most interesting earnings report of the week will come from the world’s second-largest software company, Oracle (NYSE:NYSE:ORCL). The Redwood City, CA-based company reports numbers for their first quarter on Monday, September 17, amid accusations that it misled investors when its executives explained why cloud sales were growing.\\nORCL Weekly 2015-2018\\nAccording to reports last month, the City of Sunrise Firefighters’ Pension Fund, claimed in a lawsuit, that Oracle engaged in coercion and threats to sell its cloud-computing products, creating an unsustainable model that fell apart. The Florida-based firefighter pension fund and other investors lost money when Oracle’s stock plummeted in March after releasing a disappointing earnings report and outlook, according to the lawsuit.\\nIn the cloud computing software and services market, Oracle is struggling to catch up to rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Oracle stopped disclosing specific cloud sales metrics as of June, fueling speculation that it was losing the market share. Trading at $49.25, Oracle shares are up just 4% for the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nLooking at the stock price of the world’s largest retailer, it seems Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investors are confused about its future growth possibilities.\\nEvery post-earning rally faded quickly and now that we’re almost done with 2018, Walmart has barely budged. One possible explanation for this dismal performance is that investors are still skeptical the big-box retailer can compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is fast encroaching on its territory.\\nWalmart (WMT) 1-Year Chart\\nOther factors contributing to the stock’s sluggish performance include rising costs, U.S.-China trade battles and the uncertainty over the general direction of the markets and the economy.\\nBut hidden beneath the cloudy outlook are some strong signs that show this retail giant is entering a strong growth period that will continue for several years.\\nThat growth cycle has been fueled by the company’s massive investments in its online channels, its focus on cleaner and better-stocked stores and improvement in its offerings of groceries, which are key to its long-term success.\\nOnline Sales Growth Justifies Splashing The Cash\\nThe result of these efforts has been quite astonishing over the past two quarters. A turnaround in same-store sales that started in the third-quarter of fiscal 2015 has gained pace this year and there are good reasons to believe that it will continue in 2019.\\nDuring the past two quarters, Walmart’s e-commerce business has expanded by around 40%, a very impressive reading on a metric so crucial for the company’s long-term success.\\nThat growth figure certainly justifies the company’s 2016 acquisition of e-commerce start-up, Jet.com for $3.3 billion and the most recent deal to buy 77% stake in Indian unicorn Flipkart for $16 billion.\\nWalmart offers free, nationwide two-day shipping on thousands of household goods. It expects to be able to reach 40% of U.S. households with grocery delivery by the end of this year.\\nThe company is quickly expanding its click-and-collect services, which are now available at 2,100 stores. That’s a serious challenge to Amazon, which offers pickup from Whole Foods in 22 cities.\\nNo doubt this spending is pressuring the retailer’s gross margins and making investors nervous about the retailer’s acquisition-fueled e-commerce strategy. But in our view, these initiatives will deepen Walmart’s online relationship with its millions of customers and attract millennials who have, so far, preferred Amazon and the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for their online shopping needs.\\nIn an uncertain macro environment when risks to economic growth are rising and high-growth stocks are losing their luster, Walmart is well-positioned to weather any potential storm.\\nWith its strong online presence and its vast economic power to squeeze its suppliers for lower prices, the retailer offers a great hedge during the times of distress. That power was on display during the past six months, when Walmart massively outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 by rising about 12%.\\nBottom Line\\nTo some investors, Walmart stock is expensive at its forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 20x, but that concern ignores the fact the retailer isn’t the same company it was five years ago. With its e-commerce momentum and strong core brick-and-mortar operations, we believe its shares are undervalued and offer a good entry point to long-term investors. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n- Reports Q4 2018 results on Wednesday, February 6, before the open\\n- Revenue Expectation: $36.48 billion\\n- EPS Expectation: $1.22\\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) may not have much more to impress investors when it releases its fourth-quarter earnings report next week. Earlier this month the automaker issued surprise pre-result guidance that showed it is set to reap the benefits of its restructuring drive and solid performance of its top-selling models.\\nOn January 11, GM came up with a very bullish projections for 2019, defying market expectations that a slowdown in China and higher material costs would crimp profits for automakers, who have already seen the peak of this economic boom.\\nGeneral Motors (GM) - 1-Month Chart\\nAccording to GM’s forecast, 2019 adjusted earnings will rise to between $6.50 and $7 a share, easily exceeding analysts’ estimates of $5.92. The Detroit-based company also said it will exceed the high end of its profit forecast for last year, which was $6.20 a share.\\nCost cuts, including the potential closing of five plants in North America this year, will boost 2019 profit by as much as $2.5 billion, according to the company. Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters the series of restructuring moves GM has planned will boost profit by a total of $6 billion by 2020.\\nThese bullish estimates were enough to propel GM shares in the first month of 2019, pushing its stock more than 16% higher and cutting its one-year losses to around 8%.\\nBut the road ahead isn’t as clear as GM CEO Mary Barra is forecasting.\\nIn our view, she has done a great job in setting the company’s direction at a time when traditional carmakers are facing strong headwinds, both cyclical and secular.\\nIn the near term, U.S.-China tariffs will soon begin to pinch GM earnings if both countries fail to resolve their dispute. U.S. auto sales, on the other hand, peaked in 2016 and have been falling ever since. This metric could come down yet further if consumer demand slows in China and globally. In the third quarter ended September 30, GM posted a 15% drop in deliveries to China.\\nAs well, President Donald Trump's threat to eliminate subsidies for GM in response to its announcement of job cuts and plant closings in the U.S. is likely to be a drag on the stock.\\nAside from these macro risks, GM is also facing disrupters like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet’s driverless car unit, Waymo, which started developing autonomous car technology almost a decade ago and is way ahead of the game.\\nThe ascent of the sharing economy means potentially fewer cars on the road. As these trends accelerate over the next few years, they could further depress the desire for car ownership, reducing the size of the market and the market share of individual carmakers.\\nGM's new bet on electric and driverless cars will keep the company in the race. But success isn't guaranteed. GM is competing with some deep-pocket rivals, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). For now, the revenue that drives GM’s hefty dividend, which currently yields about 4%, is coming from gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks.\\nBottom Line\\nBarra deserves credit for keeping margins healthy with flat sales and positioning the company favorably for the future of mobility. But auto stocks aren’t a good space to be in right now with so many risks lurking.\\nIn our view, GM’s stock is a good short-term trade, suitable for buy-low-sell-high investors. Betting on this stock for long-term gains hasn’t yielded much for investors in the past, and the future doesn’t look that bright as Barra predicts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nReports Q2 2019 results on Tuesday, July 23, after the close\\nRevenue expectation: $360 million\\nEPS expectation: -$0.22\\n\\nPopular social media platform operator, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) faces a huge task when it reports its second-quarter earnings tomorrow. It has to justify the 190% surge in its stock price since the December low by showing that it can sustain improvement in its user engagement metrics and sales.\\nThe operator of its photo-sharing app, Snapchat, is gaining traction after a disastrous 2018 when the number of users shrank, some of the top executives left and teenagers didn’t like the redesign of its app.\\nIn its last earnings report in late April, Snap showed that that trend is reversing. User numbers had stopped shrinking — revenue growth was better than expected, and the Snapchat app added 4 million daily users.\\nSnap’s games platform and new augmented reality features which enabled users to add graphics to their hands, feet or bodies are among the features that have been very popular in recent months, in addition to the app’s face-distorting lenses, and a gender-swap lens that turns a man face into woman, and vice versa.\\n“We believe product improvements and feature additions are driving positive trends in user growth and engagement that, along with monetization improvement from ad tech initiatives, should drive upside to consensus estimates,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts, in a note to clients this month, raising their rating on the stock to buy from neutral and boosting their 12-month price target to $18 from $13.\\nSocial Media Giants' Troubles\\nThe stock price has gained about three times since hitting a record low of $4.99 on Dec. 21, closing at $14.01 on Friday. The shares are up 145% this year, trouncing every member of the S&P 500, whose top performer, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), is up 76% in 2019.\\nSnap price chart\\nSnap’s improving financial and user metrics have no doubt played a big role in its stock’s outperformance this year, but the regulatory oversight that the large social media companies are facing is another big positive for Snap.\\nAn app with a clear and defined audience and with little room for misuse is in a much better position to withstand potential regulatory changes globally than behemoths like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) — the social media heavyweights that some politicians want to break.\\nDespite this strong comeback, however, investors who bet on Snap stock at the time of its IPO in 2017, are just recovering their losses after losing on other money-making opportunities. The benchmark S&P 500, for example, gained about 25% during that period.\\nBottom Line\\nSnap, in our view, remains a highly volatile stock and not suitable for long-term investors due to its uneven user-engagement record, escalating costs, and a higher turnover among its top executives. Instagram, owned by much bigger rival Facebook, continues to pose an existential threat to Snap that's unlikely to go away. Due to these uncertainties, we don’t recommend risk-averse investors buy this stock. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe streaming video giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has had a great start to the year. Its stock continues to be the best performer of 2019 when compared to other top technology companies.\\nIt's shares have risen 34% to $358.82 so far this year, delivering the best gains among top technology companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), up 25%, Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AAPL), up 16%, and Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AMZN), up 9.5%.\\nNetflix Weekly Chart\\nDespite this remarkable run, the year is going to one of the most challenging for the company that has changed the way people consume entertainment content. Though we like Netflix stock because of its superior content and its technology that’s fueling explosive global growth, there are some potential headwinds gathering pace this year that could halt this powerful rally going forward.\\nFirst, the year will show whether the price increases that Netflix announced in January were absorbed successfully without affecting its subscriber growth. In the biggest adjustment to its monthly subscription fee, Netflix raised prices between 13-18%. The cheapest basic plan now costs $9 a month, up from $8, while the cost of popular HD Standard plan went up to $13, from $11; and the 4K Premium plan to $16 from $14.\\nThis was the fourth time Netflix increased prices since its launch, but it was the biggest hike. No doubt the timing was great amid the success of its new content such as “Bird Box” and “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo,” but it’s hard to say to what extent the price changes will affect subscriber growth.\\nOne indication that these price increases will have some impact on growth came from the company’s latest forecast for subscribers. After seeing paid memberships increase by 8.84 million in the fourth quarter, beating Netflix's own forecast, the company seems to be taking a cautious tone for the current quarter, predicting 8.9 million new customers globally, a slight increase from the previous period.\\nCompetition Is Just Heating Up\\nAnother threat that’s just round the corner for Netflix is new competition from some of the world’s largest media companies. The most immediate one is coming from Walt Disney (NYSE:NYSE:DIS) and AT&T (NYSE:NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia as both companies gear up to launch their own streaming services later this year.\\nIn our view, Disney is the one that has the financial muscle, great content and management backing to pose the biggest challenge for Netflix. Disney’s CEO Bob Iger has made the video-streaming service a core part of its growth strategy.\\nHe is busy restructuring the company’s executive compensation, and is willing to sacrifice growth by jacking up spending for the new service, which he says will be loaded with Disney’s quality brands, such as “Avatar” and “Zootopia.”\\nIt would be naive to take the Disney threat lightly: the world's largest entertainment company has been a long-term winner in the media business and has multiple revenue streams to help it survive while it takes the Netflix fight head on. The company will soon complete the $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX)’s entertainment assets, which it plans to package in its online service.\\nWith the online streaming market becoming crowded and competition heating up, we think the next big challenge for Netflix will be to manage its cash-burn, which has been a major source of concern for many analysts.\\nIn 2018, Netflix spent $12.04 billion on content development, but this high development cost generated a negative $2.68 billion cash flows. This fiscal year, the company is likely to show $3 billion cash-burn, further boosting its debt level.\\nAs long as the company is increasing its subscribers, investors have little reason to worry about the company’s high spending, but the growing cash-burn will be the one issue that could hurt its stock if subscribers growth slows.\\nBottom Line\\nNetflix is a great company and its stock has been a great bet for investors seeking high growth. With its huge subscriber base, successful content strategy and superior technology, it’s hard not to like Netflix stock. However, we think it's important to highlight the major risks this company will face in 2019, so that investors aren't taken by surprise if the journey gets a little bumpy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAfter suffering huge losses during the final days of 2018, suddenly it seems all is good again for stock investors. The U.S. and China appear to be inching closer to a trade deal that could remove the uncertainty that's been shadowing markets for months. Indeed, on Friday, President Donald Trump confirmed this, then added that he might extend the March 1 deadline for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods.\\nThis alone has the potential to spur this bull run on for another year. Another powerful signal came from U.S. consumer sentiment which rebounded from a two-year low, further fueling the rally in stocks that sent the S&P 500 to a 10-week high.\\nThough global trade continues to dominate markets, there remain some big earning reports scheduled for the coming week. We're focusing on three stocks which could see some volatility after their companies announce Q4 2018 numbers and release future outlooks.\\n1. Walmart\\nThe world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Feb. 19, before the market opens. On average, analysts see $1.33 a share profit on the sales of $138.66 billion.\\nWMT Weekly\\nOne of the biggest worries Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investors continue to pay attention to is how the retailer will keep improving its margins when costs continue escalating. Along with controlling costs, Walmart also needs to show that its e-commerce strategy is well on track to counter online competitors, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well as digital upstarts that are attracting millennial shoppers in droves.\\nGiven these challenges, in our view, Walmart’s quarterly report card thus far has been impressive. A turnaround in same-store sales, which started in the third-quarter of fiscal 2015, has gained pace in the company’s fiscal 2019.\\nAs of its most recent report on Nov. 15, 2018, comparable store sales rose yet again, for a total of 16 consecutive quarters. Walmart shares, which closed at $99.99 on Friday, have gained 7.3% so far this year. We believe the stock will see additional gains if the retailer continues to show strong growth in the same-store sales and further expansion in its e-commerce business.\\n2. CVS Health\\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) reports on Wednesday, Feb. 20, before the market opens. Concerns persist regarding the integration costs on its $69-billion merger with Aetna (NYSE:AET), which closed in late November, making the merged entity one of the largest health care insurance and benefits companies in the industry.\\nThe merger is a way for CVS to beef up its brick-and-mortar operations with the services side of the industry, a response to Amazon's efforts at taking on the healthcare industry. Though investors have liked this deal, integration challenges could force the company to lower its guidance for 2019.\\nCVS Weekly\\nDuring the past three months, CVS stock has fallen 12%, massively underperforming the S&P 500. However, good news on the Aetna merger and signs of cost controls could push the stock higher, breaking the bearish spell. Trading at $69.53, the stock remains well below analysts’ 12-month consensus price target of $88.57 a share.\\nFor Wednesday's earnings report, consensus estimates call for CVS to post $2.05 a share profit, up from $1.92 a year ago. Sales are likely to jump 13% to $54.58 billion.\\n3. Wayfair\\nPrice action may be extraordinarily volatile after online furniture retailer Wayfair (NYSE:W) reports its Q4 earnings on Friday, Feb.22, before the markets open. Analysts have honed in on the company’s growing losses, worsening free cash flow and surging market spending.\\nW Weekly\\nWhen the company reported its Q3 earnings in November it missed expectations. Shares plunged 17% afterward.\\nThough the stock has since recovered those losses, at $122.11 per share as of Friday's close, it’s still trading 23% below its 52-week high of $151.2. As well, risks to downside still remain elevated: analysts expect losses to widen to $1.28 a share from $0.58 during the year-ago period. However, sales are likely to expand by 37% to $1.97 billion.\\nThere's little doubt the company has mastered the art of selling big-ticket furniture items online globally. Still, it has yet to show how it can do this profitably. The stakes for Wayfair to show a path to profitability quickly, are high, especially when bigger rivals, such as Amazon, are getting ready to enter the online furniture sales arena. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n* Reports Q1 2019 results on Thursday, May 2, before the market open* Revenue Expectation: $4.38 billion* EPS Expectation: $0.58\\nTeva Pharmaceuticals' (NYSE:TEVA) turnaround has been a tough sell for its Chief Executive Officer, Kare Schultz, at least in 2019.\\nThe share price of the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs has tumbled more than 40% from the 52-week high reached in August, amid concerns that the worst for the company’s growth isn’t over yet. Its stock was trading at $15.22 a share at yesterday's close, after sinking 2.5% through the session.\\nTeva Weekly Chart\\nAnalysts’ consensus forecast for profit and sales for the first-quarter suggests the investment community still remains doubtful about the company’s transition to stability. During tomorrow's release, Israel-based Teva is likely to report its profit fell to $0.58 a share from $0.94 a share from the year ago period, while sales to shrank 13.5% to $4.38 billion, according to analysts’ average estimate.\\nTeva is trying to recover from a slump, started in the summer of 2015, that sent its shares tumbling as the company invested heavily to grow its copycat medicines business. That happened at a time when margins began to shrink in the U.S. amid fierce competition from other pharma producers. The biggest setback came when Teva lost its monopoly on Copaxone, a blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection that at one point generated half of Teva’s profits.\\nThat bearish outlook, however, will change quickly if Schultz can show that his cost-cutting efforts are working and the company has been able to control the decline in sales. We feel that outcome is unlikely this year, given the company’s earlier warnings that growth will not return until next year and that 2019 will continue to be a “tough” year.\\nTeva Is a Compelling Value Play\\nBut Teva, in our view, offers a compelling value opportunity if your investing horizon is long-term and you’re comfortable staying invested for the next few years. One big reason making us bullish on this beaten-down stock is the CEO’s measurable success in trimming Teva’s costs and its huge pile of debt.\\nAgainst a very tough operating environment, Schultz managed to cut spending by $2.2 billion last year and will close or sell another 11 manufacturing plants in 2019, which would bring the total figure to about 60 sites.\\nTeva is also on track to meet its overall target of $3 billion in savings by the end of 2019, and may close more plants afterward, Schultz said in February. As a result of these measures, the company’s debt has fallen to $29 billion from its 2016 peak of $36 billion.\\nTeva’s robust pipeline of new drugs is another bright spot in the company’s turnaround plan. The recent approval of its next-generation migraine medication Ajovy has so far not created much excitement, but this drug has a great future and could bring in a significant new revenue stream in the next two to three years.\\nMore than 36 million people suffer from these debilitating episodes and the medicine could generate around $500 million in sales by 2022, according to analysts’ estimates. Teva's Huntington's disease medicine Austedo could also prove another big revenue generator, which would help the drugmaker arrest the slide in its sales. Austedo's peak sales are forecast to reach as high as $1.3 billion within the next three years.\\nBottom Line\\nDespite the 2019 setback, we continue to see improvement in Teva’s financials and investor perception going forward as the company successfully implements its three-year turnaround plan and the U.S. generic drug market shows signs of stability. Schultz’s belt-tightening, an impressive pipeline of new drugs, and the backing of large investors, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRKa) and Capital Group Companies, make Teva a good turnaround stock for long-term investors. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nFor FedEx (NYSE:FDX) a slowdown in global growth isn’t a possibility. It’s already here.\\nWhile announcing its fiscal second-quarter earnings this week, the company drastically slashed its fiscal 2019 profit forecast, just three months after the package delivery company had raised it. Adjusted earnings in 2019 will be no more than $16.60 a share, FedEx said in a statement Tuesday. That was below the lowest analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.\\nFedEx 5-Hour Chart\\nFedEx’s earnings, which come almost a month earlier than the fourth-quarter numbers of the majority of US companies, generally attract close attention because the delivery business is a proxy for the global economy and could give early warnings on trade and business investment issues.\\nUnfortunately, the global shipper didn’t have good news for investors.\\nCEO Fred Smith said on the conference call:\\n\\n“When you have a change that comes on you as fast as this did, it’s hard to react to it.\\nOur international business, especially in Europe, weakened significantly since we last talked with you.”\\n\\nFedEx’s view on global growth and its impact on business is one of the clearest admissions by any global company that we have seen the peak of global expansion and the best is behind us.\\nInvestors took the gloomy prediction seriously, sending FedEx shares tumbling the most in a decade. During the past three months, FedEx shares are down about 35 percent—more than twice the decline in the benchmark S&P 500, which is down about 15.5%.\\nFedEx’s Grim View Means Get Defensive\\nThe stock’s underperformance and the company’s grim outlook are a warning for investors that they should avoid buying cyclical growth stocks tied to global growth, as they might see further erosion in values in the first quarter of 2019.\\nAt FedEx, international revenue fell short of company expectations in the three months ended Nov. 30. In Asia, FedEx cited “continued tariff and trade concerns” as a drag. In Europe, it pointed to deterioration in Germany and Italy, as well as uncertainty in the UK over the country’s negotiations to leave the European Union.\\nTo deal with sudden changes in the economic environment, the delivery company plans to start a voluntary buyout program for its US and international workers. FedEx employs more than 450,000 people globally.\\nThe company said the vast majority of its buyout offers will be made to workers at the FedEx Express unit, which has 227,000 employees, and at FedEx Services, which provides back-office functions and employs another 30,000 people.\\nFedEx’s outlook on global trade and the economy cements our view that investors should increase the number of defensive stocks in their portfolios. These stocks are better positioned to withstand the economic slowdown, or even a recession.\\nThat means picking stocks from the basic industries, such as utilities, telecom operators and top healthcare companies. These defensive areas of the market have a long track record of doing better in times of uncertainty while offering steadily growing dividends.\\nBottom Line\\nCompanies such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) are among the best defensive bets for long-term investors in this market downturn. These companies could outperform the broader market if we’re in for a deep correction and a possible recession in 2019. Diversifying your portfolio with defensive stocks that pay regularly growing dividends is always a good strategy. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nStocks that provide safety and consistent income have been out of favor for many years. As an unprecedented bull run continued, many investors put all their eggs in the growth basket.\\nBut now that many high-flying technology stocks have reversed course, the importance of slow-moving income stocks is gaining attention. That area of the market provides a hedge against times of extreme volatility and economic slowdown.\\nIn this segment, we particularly like power and gas utilities due to the defensive nature of their businesses and their highly regulated revenue. In fact, utilities that provide power, gas and water to homes and offices don't just pay dividends, but have, in most cases, regularly increased those payouts for decades.\\nDue to the changing market dynamics, we see investors increasingly embracing defensive/income stocks over growth/momentum plays as we enter in 2019. Here are our two top utility picks.\\nDuke Energy’s Plan Will Support Dividend Growth\\nWith an annual dividend yield of 4.27% and $3.71 a share payout, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is an attractive utility stock to own. Duke is a well-diversified power and gas utility serving some of the key markets in the U.S.\\nDuke Energy (DUK) - 1-Year Chart\\nThrough its diversified power, gas and storage businesses, the utility plans to deliver between 4% and 6% annual dividend growth. We believe the utility is well-positioned to reward its long-term investors following a major restructuring in its portfolio in recent years.\\nThat shakeup included selling carbon-based power assets and foreign operations, buying a natural gas utility and expanding its reach in renewable power. Today the utility's business is largely driven by regulated assets and long-term contract businesses consisting of midstream pipelines and renewable power.\\nThe company has a $37 billion development plan to run between 2018 and 2022. This level of spending is mainly targeted at regulated assets to support the company’s inflation-beating dividend growth.\\nAfter rising about 9% during the past three months, Duke stock has outperformed the major indices, showing that it’s receiving capital flows that are moving to less-risky assets as markets go through a period of downturn. Even with these gains, the utility’s 4%-plus dividend yield is attractive enough to make a long-term bet on this stock.\\nEnbridge Is Attractive Long Term After Recent Share Weakness\\nCalgary-based Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is another utility stock that we find attractive due to its juicy 6.28% annual dividend yield that translates into $2.03-a-share payout.\\nEnbridge (ENB) - 1-Year Chart\\nEnbridge is the largest pipeline operator in North America, with its network handling 28% of the crude oil produced in the region. The company also moves about 22% of all natural gas consumed in the U.S., serving key supply basins and demand markets.\\nDue to this significant role in the region’s energy infrastructure, Enbridge stock is a relatively safe bet for the long run. The company’s strong cash-generating capability through a regulated rate structure also makes it a dependable stock to earn stable income during any recession or market downturn.\\nIn addition, Enbridge has an excellent dividend history. Over the past 20 years, its payout has grown at an average compound annual growth rate of 11.7%.\\nEnbridge is expecting 10% growth in the annual dividend through 2020 as it undertakes $22 billion worth of development projects.\\nEnbridge stock is down about 18% this year as the company goes through a major restructuring, selling some non-core assets and cutting its high debt load.\\nOnce done with this exercise, we see a major upside in this stock, most likely in the next 12 months.\\nFor long-term investors, this is a good time to buy Enbridge as its valuations are compelling.\\nBottom Line\\nInvesting in utility stocks looks boring with their slow growth and almost bond-type returns. But these defensive stocks are ideal for long-term investors whose objective is to earn steadily growing income. Duke and Enbridge fit the bill. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nBeyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ:BYND) investors who bought shares in last week's initial public offering (IPO) have every reason to feel pleased with themselves. The stock has jumped almost 200% since the maker of plant-based burgers raised $240 million in the highly successful IPO on May 2.\\nThe demand for its shares has been so strong that its debut on the NASDAQ last Friday was the best among IPOs that raised $200 million or more since before the 2008 financial crisis, according to Bloomberg data.\\nBeyond Meat’s initial public offering was priced at $25 a share, the top end of the $23-$25 range, valuing the company at just under $1.5 billion. At its $68.84 opening price on Monday, the company's market cap had soared to $3.97 billion after just three days of trading. The shares closed up 12% yesterday, at $74.79.\\nBeyond Meat Hourly Chart\\nClever Marketing Push\\nWhat’s unique about the El Segundo, California maker of plant-based burgers and sausages that attracted investors like Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio in its early days? Beyond Meat is targeting consumers who are seeking a meat substitute that looks and tastes good. Beyond Meat’s biggest attraction is that its products come surprisingly close to real meat in taste, smell, texture and appearance.\\nLuckily for Beyond Meat, the $878 million-a-year-and-growing market for meat substitutes was left open by big food players for startups like Beyond Meat and privately-held Impossible Foods Inc. to fill the gap. To capture this broad market opportunity, Beyond Meat developed three plant-based products that align with the largest meat categories globally: beef, pork and poultry.\\nBut what made Beyond Meat products tick in 11,000 U.S. grocery stores was the company’s clever marketing strategy that sought shelf space where mainstream customers looked for their meat, instead of just going after vegans who make up less than 5% of the U.S. population.\\nThe company’s growing revenue suggests that meat consumers in the U.S. are likely the company’s customers. From just $8.8 million in 2015, Beyond Meat’s net revenue rose to $56.4 million in the first nine months of the fiscal year 2018, according to the company’s prospectus. That number was 167% higher when compared to the same period a year ago.\\nThe story looks great and very reassuring for those who got hold of Beyond Beat shares during the IPO stage, or on the first day of its public debut. But going forward, that upward growth trajectory isn’t going to be entirely straightforward, in our view.\\nRisk of Competition\\nFirst, Beyond Meat’s market doesn’t have very high barriers to entry. Learning from its success, more large and small food players will inevitably enter the market and fill the shelf space with more choices.\\nTyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), the largest U.S. meat producer, is probably the first big threat to Beyond Meat. The company sold its stake in Beyond Meat just before its IPO, signaling its intention to play hard in the vegetarian protein market.\\nThe company plans to accelerate and develop its own alternative-protein business line, and every kind of protein is on the table from legumes and peas to mushrooms and insects, Justin Whitmore, Tyson’s chief sustainability officer said in March.\\n“We’re going to be making significant investments in the space,” Whitmore told Bloomberg. “The companies and ecosystem that are in place to provide protein to the world can do the same thing for alternative protein — the mechanics of the supply chain all the way from the farm to your plate don’t necessarily change.”\\nIn an environment that's shaping up to be pretty cutthroat, this means that Beyond Meat will have to spend a lot on R&D and marketing. That spending will make it harder for the company to achieve profitability sooner. In the first nine months of 2018, the company lost more than $22 million on the sales of $56 million.\\nBottom Line\\nBeyond Meat has grabbed the attention of a market in which a lot of money is chasing very few good ideas. But in that process, its stock has become too expensive and risky. We don’t think Beyond Meat's rally justifies its 44 times 2018 sale multiple over the long run, given the competitive threats from large players. The stock has run its course and is vulnerable to a correction. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n* Reports Q1 2019 results on Tuesday, May 21 before the market open* Revenue expectation: $26.37 billion* EPS expectation: $2.18\\nHome Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) isn't expected to report very promising first-quarter results tomorrow. The largest U.S. home-improvement retailer is releasing earnings tomorrow amid signs of a housing slowdown and a spring season too wet for Americans to go out and buy their gardening supplies.\\nIf these two factors hurt Home Depot’s earnings, it will prolong the weakness that started in late 2018. The company reported comparable sales rose 3.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in early February, well short of the 4.5% gain analysts had been expecting. That miss came after the company experienced one of the strongest expansions in its history, delivering year-over-year comparable sales growth for 30 straight quarters.\\nAlong with a soft housing market, mother nature isn't helping Home Depot much. Across much of the Great Plains, Midwest and Northeast, the first green burst of spring was about a week to 10 days late, the USA National Phenology Network said on April 30. That means Home Depot sales related to the gardening season, its equivalent of Christmas, may not show much growth in the first quarter. Spring is the season when many shoppers buy gardening supplies and start home renovations, making it a key quarter for home improvement retailers. Home Depot’s Q1 ends April 29.\\nShort-Term Setbacks\\nBut beyond these short-term setbacks, there is little to suggest the boom-period for the retailer is over. The latest developments on the economic front, particularly in the housing market, suggest that the housing weakness that started in September of last year isn’t deepening.\\nU.S. new-home construction rose for a second month and topped estimates in April in a sign of positive momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter. To counter a possible hit from the U.S.-China trade war, the Fed has moved to the sidelines, helping mortgage rates to stabilize.\\nConsumer spending, on the other hand, is still solid, as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:NYSE:WMT) showed last week. The world’s largest retailer reported its strongest Q1 comparable sales growth in nine years.\\nHelped by this economic strength, Home Depot stock has weathered the current market slump nicely, gaining more than 12% this year, to close Friday’s session at $192.58. The other catalysts also boosting the company's upward trajectory are its attractive dividends and massive buyback plan aimed at supporting the stock if it becomes undervalued.\\nHome Depot Weekly Chart\\nBottom Line\\nAn improving U.S. housing market and strong consumer spending should continue to buoy Home Depot’s share price this year, despite some setbacks early in the year. Any post-earnings weakness should offer a good buying opportunity for investors who are looking for a smart entry point. The retailer is a good buy-and-hold candidate, even through the threat to the economy from the U.S.-China trade war escalation. Its quarterly dividend has expanded 500% over the past decade and, with a healthy payout ratio of 42%, it has lots more room to grow. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nFor many investors, daily noise in the market doesn’t mean much. Their investment objective is to build a portfolio strong enough to produce a steady stream of income during their retirement.\\nThis is a journey which spans many decades, requires investing with discipline, plus, of course, picking some quality income-generating stocks. As years tick-by and you continue to stick with your strategy, you’ll realize how quickly you’re moving closer to your goal of achieving financial freedom in your golden years.\\nWith this theme in mind, here's one of the best dividend-growth stocks currently available. It hits all the characteristics necessary to make it an ideal asset for long-term income investors.\\nThe Coca-Cola Company \\nThe companies that generally fit into an income-producing portfolio are the ones which have dominant positions in their fields, a strong brand and massive scale which is hard for competitors to reach. Looking at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) from this perspective, it’s exactly the type of business which ticks all these boxes.\\nKO Monthly 2013-2018\\nThe world’s largest beverage company owns or licenses more than 500 non-alcoholic soft drinks, including both sparkling and still beverages. It sells its products in more than 200 countries, and has 21 individual brands that generate $1 billion or more in annual sales.\\nThe core sparkling beverage portfolio includes the flagship Coca-Cola brand, as well as other globally recognized soda brands such as Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and more. Coca-Cola also has a large portfolio of still beverages, including Dasani, Minute Maid, Vitamin Water, and Honest Tea.\\nThe company enjoys top market share positions across a number of its core product categories. With this massive global scale, the most important thing for dividend investors is to see whether this soft-drink giant is a reliable dividend payer and thus worth adding to their income-producing portfolio.\\nCoca-Cola is a “Dividend King”, meaning it belongs to a small, elite group of blue-chip companies, which have hiked their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. History, of course, doesn’t provide a guarantee for future performance, but it can certainly tell us a lot about the business and its strengths. Nevertheless, given that Coca-Cola has been able to increase its dividend for 55 years in a row, that's more than enough proof of the strength of the brand and the company’s ability to perform across a variety of economic and cultural events—recessions, downturns and changing consumer preferences.\\nBusiness Transformation\\nWithout doubt, the ongoing consumer trend to cut consumption of sugary drinks has caused some headwinds for Coca-Cola, but the company is changing its business model fast. Currently, 19 of Coca-Cola’s 22 billion-dollar brands offer consumers reduced-, low-, or zero-calorie options. In its most recent earnings report, Coca-Cola showed it has started to reap the benefits of its business transformation.\\nIn February, the company reported sales and profit for the fourth-quarter that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by its growing beverage portfolio of healthy drinks and reformulations. The key part of this business transformation includes becoming a marketing and drink-formulation company, introducing new product lines and slimming down the costs.\\nIn recent years, Coke has invested in many new ventures, including Honest Tea, Fairlife Dairy and Suja Life LLC, which makes high-pressure processed juices, kombucha and drinking vinegars. Coca-Cola is expanding this model globally and has already started looking for investment candidates in Central and Eastern Europe, according to company statements.\\nThe bottom line: Dividend-growth stocks with a track record of rewarding their investors are your best friends in retirement. Dividend stocks help grow your portfolio and protect your income from rising inflation. Coca-Cola has paid a quarterly dividend since 1920 and has increased dividends in each of the last 55 years. In the latest-quarter, Coca-Cola boosted its annual dividend by 5.5% to $1.56 a share from $1.48 a share in 2017. Trading at $43.22 as of yesterday's close, and with an annual dividend yield of 3.54%, KO shares should be on the top of your buying list as you build your retirement portfolio. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIt’s becoming quite tough to remain positive about the world’s second-largest chipmaker, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) these days. The company is losing some of its biggest customers, while smaller competitors are encroaching on its backyard.\\nThis alarming situation has taken a heavy toll on the stock. It's fallen about 14% over the past three months, closing down for the third straight session yesterday at $47.75, and has significantly underperformed the industry benchmark, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which remained relatively unchanged over the past quarter.\\nIntel price chart\\nIn the same period, Intel competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) surged more than 20%, adding to its 80% gains year-to-date, bucking the industry-wide weakness.\\nAnd on top of dealing with the cyclical downturn that’s hurting the semiconductor industry this year, Intel has some serious issues of its own to contend with. The firm is facing a tough competitive environment in an industry that thrives on producing the smallest, most efficient and powerful chips in the highest volumes.\\nIntel’s Manufacturing Woes\\nThe latest information from the company suggests that it is falling behind in this race, opening the doors for rivals to threaten its near-monopoly in the personal-computer and server markets. The biggest worry for Intel investors is that the manufacturing problems are fairly widespread and are causing a slowdown even at the company’s most established units.\\nLast year, investors were disappointed when Intel confirmed that it wouldn’t mass-produce semiconductors made with 10-nanometer technology until later this year. Vivek Araya, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said at the time that delays offer rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and AMD the possibility to “leapfrog” ahead of Intel by rolling out their own lower-cost, higher-performing chips.\\nAdding to Intel's woes in recent months have been the shortages of parts at the company’s PC unit. Those shortages were forecast to continue through the first half of the year, hurting both sales growth and gross margins. In his first earnings call as CEO in April, Bob Swan cut the full-year forecast, mainly citing the effects of weak memory pricing and a lull in demand for server processors.\\nLater that week, he told a meeting of analysts that Intel’s growth would be in the “low single digit” range over the next three years with gross margins also coming under pressure as Intel tries to resolve its manufacturing problems.\\nHowever, after the company's share price slid some 20% from the 52-week peak this year, Intel shares appear cheap to several analysts. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 10.68, the lowest ratio since 2015, and a dividend yield of about 2.60%, Intel's valuation looks attractive to some. But there's a big risk to this valuation: another downward adjustment in revenue forecast may be just around the corner when the company releases its Q2 earnings release on July 25.\\nAccording to a recent note by research house Raymond James, the lingering U.S.-China trade dispute that resulted in a 25% tariff on Chinese goods and the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies Co. is likely to spark a round of earnings warnings across the semiconductor industry.\\nBottom Line\\nDespite the sharp correction, we don’t believe the time is right to bet on Intel stock as yet. There's a growing potential for further worsening in investor sentiment, especially if chip companies make deeper cuts to their earnings forecasts for the second-half. That, in our view, could provide a more compelling risk-reward equation to build a long-term position in Intel. Until then, investors should wait on the sidelines. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIt didn’t take much to see a turnaround in one of the worst-performing sectors in the technology space last year.\\nShares of chipmakers, that benefited from the exploding use of smartphones, cloud computing, and huge investment in data centers by the world’s largest tech companies, are regaining their lost ground fast this year with some of the stocks on their way to post their best first-quarter gains in more than two years.\\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the industry's biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards, has surged 28% so far this year, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), has seen its stock rallying more than 36%.\\nThe benchmark PHLX Semiconductor Index has posted gains of more than 26% in 2019, outpacing the S&P 500’s 14% surge. This fast and powerful rally in chip stocks is causing confusion among investors, as many of the negative factors that sent these shares tumbling last year are still lurking.\\nPHLX Semiconductor Index, Weekly\\nFor example, the U.S. and China are still working through a trade deal that may not shape up the way the markets are expecting. U.S. President Donald Trump said yesterday he doesn’t plan to do away with trade tariffs on China until he's sure Beijing is fully complying with any possible trade deal.\\nSemiconductor companies have a major portion of their growth tied to China, where spending on gaming and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for their products. A slowing global economy, especially a more pronounced slowdown in China, will continue to keep demand under pressure this year. The S&P 500 semiconductor group is forecast to report a 24% drop in first-quarter profits from a year earlier, compared with a 3.6% decline expected for the S&P 500, according to FactSet.\\nChipmakers’ Powerful Rebound\\nOne possible explanation of chipmakers’ powerful comeback is that some companies have rekindled hopes of an early recovery after producing better than expected fourth-quarter earnings and predicting strong demand for their products. AMD, the second-largest maker of computer processors, reported profit for Q4 that met analysts’ expectations and predicted a positive outlook for 2019.\\nSome investors found a good reason to buy Nvidia shares after the company didn’t perform worse than analysts’ expectations after an earlier warning by Chief Executive Jensen Huang, who saw Q4 producing “a real punch in the gut.”\\nDespite this impressive rebound, we continue to remain doubtful about the sustainability of this rally. Investors shouldn’t forget that the global economy still remains vulnerable and hostage to the U.S-China trade negotiations. A scenario where demand could revive quickly for chip producers is too optimistic.\\nBuying shares of Nvidia and AMD, the two leading gainers this year, also carries additional risks for long-term investors, given the highly cyclical nature of their products and too much volatility in their share values. Nvidia, for example, lost more than half of its market value between October and December last year on signs that its two main markets, gaming and data centers, are slowing down.\\nIf you want to take a position in the semiconductor sector, then we find Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). a more sustainable long-term bet. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 11, close to the lowest ratio since 2015, and a dividend yield of about 2.33%, Intel looks appealing for long-term investors.\\nIn our view, Intel enjoys greater power to sustain prolonged weakness in demand with a market share of about 99% for memory chips that run servers, the machines that companies and individuals need to run internet and large networks.\\nBottom Line\\nInvesting in chip stocks after a powerful relief rally doesn’t make sense, especially when threats to their growth haven’t fully subsided yet. Any negative development on the U.S.-China trade negotiations, more bad news on the Chinese economic front, and a possible slowdown in the U.S. expansion are some of the headwinds that call for avoiding semiconductor stocks in general. That said, we find Intel stock offering a better risk-reward preposition for long-term investors than highly cyclical Nvidia and AMD stocks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nBig-box retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) appear to have successfully cracked the code to boosting online sales. Failure in the race to capture consumers who increasingly don't want to come to physical stores was not an option for these giants. And the latest earnings reports from both retailers showed these companies have established an impressive track-record to improve their online presence.\\nTarget's fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday showed online sales rose 31%, marking the company’s fifth consecutive year of digital sales growth above 25%.\\nWMT Weekly TTM\\nWalmart, the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, has a similar story to tell. Its e-commerce sales surged 43% in the fourth-quarter, its eighth straight quarter of growth in e-commerce. For the current-year, the company is maintaining its 35% growth forecast, a slight deceleration but still quite an impressive pace.\\nA solid growth trajectory in these retailers' online businesses removes a big drag on their share prices. Many analysts feared that the huge monetary resources these giants allocated for their online expansions would push costs higher and suppress their margins.\\nTGT Weekly TTM\\nWalmart shares fell more than 5% in 2018, while Target stock weakened slightly during the period when the U.S. consumers opened up their purse strings, helped by the Trump Administration’s tax cuts and a robust economy. Both stocks have rebounded strongly in 2019 with Walmart surging 13% to $98.34 and Target 17% to $76 a share at the Tuesday close.\\nE-Commerce Success Fueling Gains\\nOver many past quarters, these retailers have proved that their huge brick-and-mortar presence gives them an advantage that no other online competitor can match. Walmart offers free, nationwide two-day shipping on thousands of household goods. It expects to be able to reach 40% of U.S. households with grocery delivery by the end of this year.\\nThe company is quickly expanding its click-and-collect services. Last year, it added about 1,000 grocery pickup locations, and reached nearly 800 grocery delivery points.That’s a serious challenge to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which offers pickup from Whole Foods in 22 cities.\\nTarget, on the other hand, is benefiting from its $550-million acquisition of a grocery delivery startup Shipt Inc. in 2017. The retailer is now offering consumers the option to order online and pick up in store.\\nAt the core of its e-commerce success is the company’s ability to use its massive store network as warehouses to serve its online orders. Three-quarters of digital sales for its fourth quarter were fulfilled by stores, giving the company an immense power to satisfy customers and cut costs.\\nBottom Line\\nWith these top retailers showing consistent success in their e-commerce push, it’s hard not to get excited about their future prospects. We believe their shares—Walmart closed yesterday at $98.26 while Target finished the trading day at $76.90—will continue to benefit from their expanding online presence combined with their strong brick-and-mortar operations. Both Walmart and Target pay growing dividends, with yields currently at 2.16% and 3.37% respectively, that offer a good hedge should the economy slow. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nInvesting in big oil stocks has never been simple. It’s almost impossible to predict the direction of energy markets. Many top forecasters have tried to get this right but have failed miserably.\\nPicking the right stock from the group of energy giants trading on US indices has become more complicated since the collapse of energy market prices in 2015-2016. There’s also been increasing uncertainty over the future of oil and gas given the rise of renewables, electric cars, and a global push to curb climate change. Plus OPEC/non-OPEC driven production cuts and increases add to the volatility.\\nNevertheless, shares of two of the US's 'supermajors' in this space, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), have traditionally provided investors with stable dividend income and moderate capital gains. Which stock offers better long-term prospects right now?\\nExxonMobil: Struggling Giant\\nOver the past 5 years, among experienced investors, ExxonMobil stock has lost its allure. The company's shares diverged from other big oil stocks, falling about 10% during the past two years when Chevron, for example, surged by 24%.\\nXOM Weekly\\nThe biggest challenge this supermajor faced during this period was how to boost its output during one of the worst oil slumps, something that began in 2014. Exxon’s production has dropped in five of the last six years. In April, the company posted its worst first-quarter production figures since Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999.\\nTo counter this slump and improve its long-term outlook, Exxon is undertaking a massive $200-billion expansion project over the next seven years. The company plans to invest heavily in low-cost mega-projects that will help it maintain its dominance in oil and natural gas markets for decades to come.\\nAs part of this plan, Exxon will increase its minimal oil production in the U.S. Permian Basin five-fold, and start up 25 projects worldwide, which will add more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day to the company's production volume. In 2017, ExxonMobil added 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.\\nIf all this materializes and the price of oil remains around $60 a barrel, Exxon’s management expects the company will be able to double earnings by 2025. It reported $4.65 billion in net income for the quarter that ended in March.\\nBut that bet might backfire, particularly since many analysts are calling for oil demand to peak in the next 10 to 15 years due to rising use of electric cars and the global push to invest in renewable energy sources and cut back on carbon emissions.\\nAccording to BP (NYSE:BP), one of the world’s largest oil producers, self-driving electric vehicles will cause a revolution in transportation over the next two decades, leading global oil demand to peak by the late 2030s. The forecast marks the first time BP has shown oil consumption peaking in its long-term forecasts but the UK group said it saw little risk of a precipitous decline in demand.\\nChevron: A Different Approach\\nWhile Exxon is on a spending binge, Chevron has taken a different approach. The company is keeping its spending low and trying to squeeze more juice from existing assets. According to management, it intends to maintain low levels of capital spending ($18 billion to $20 billion annually) from 2018 to 2020.\\nChevron estimates it will grow production by 4-7% annually between 2017 and 2020. Indeed, it appears the company’s short-term plan is working. In the first quarter, Chevron surpassed every profit and production estimate, raising the possibility of a resumption of share buybacks later this year, something that was suspended in 2015.\\nChevron Weekly 2015-2018\\nThe company also pumped more crude and natural gas than observers anticipated. Chevron earned $1.90 a share during the first three months of the year, exceeding the $1.47 average of analysts’ consensus estimates.\\nIn order to appease investors, CEO Mike Wirth hinted in April that he would consider resuming the company’s share buybacks, a move which has fueled gains in its share price. Exxon, on the other hand, has expressed a preference to increase spending on major oil and gas projects over buying back shares.\\nWhich Is A Better Bet?\\nIt’s not difficult to see that investors aren't excited about Exxon’s long-term growth strategy. Clearly they see a lot of risks going forward in this uncertain demand and supply environment. Since Darren Woods became the CEO of Exxon in 2017, shares has fallen 8%, closing yesterday at $80.82, compared with an 8% gain for its biggest American rival, Chevron which yesterday closed at $125.97.\\nThat said, I think both Exxon and Chevron are great dividend stocks with a terrific income appeal for long-term investors. Exxon’s dividend yield after a recent pullback in its share price is over 4%, the highest level since mid-1990s; Chevron's yield is only marginally lower, currently 3.61%.\\nIf you’re a long-term investor and want to have some exposure to oil stocks, the truth is we like both Exxon and Chevron, despite their different paths to achieving growth. Each has a rock-solid balance-sheet and low-level of long-term debt. To be honest, we don’t see an investor going wrong by picking either of these giants.\\nDespite recent sluggishness, Exxon shares have rewarded investors handsomely over the long run. They’ve provided a total return of 1,654% over the past 30 years, more than 400 percentage points higher than the S&P 500 Energy Index. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) is one of the few tech companies that just keep crushing expectations. Quarter-after-quarter this social media giant produces profits which beat analysts’ forecasts, continually propelling its share price to new highs.\\nRevenue surged 47% during the first nine months of 2017 and its juicy profit margin remains a dream for most industry executives. Facebook generated $0.46 of operating profit on each dollar of revenue it made in the same period.\\nFB Weekly 2015-2017\\nBut after a 50% rally last year, it appears Facebook\\'s stock could have a bumpy ride in 2018. Its shares plunged 5% on January 12 after the company announced that it plans to change the way it lets users consume news.\\nFB Daily\\nThe move is intended to boost social interactions over stories from publishers. In other words, going forward, Facebook intends to help users have \"more meaningful social interactions\" instead of finding \"relevant content.” In practice, this means that Facebook users will see less public content from businesses or publishers and more posts from their friends and families.\\nMark Zuckerberg announced the changes in a post on his own Facebook page due to the sensitivity of this policy change on the company’s earnings. “I want to be clear: by making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,” Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n“But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable. And if we do the right thing, I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too.”\\n\\nRevenue Implications \\nFacebook is changing its newsfeed following widespread criticism that the company let “fake news” proliferate over its social network during the last U.S. presidential election.This lapse may have given U.S. adversaries, such as Russia, an opportunity to manipulate the outcome, according to some observers.\\nAs the probe into Russian involvement in the U.S. election intensifies, Facebook is pivoting away from publishers as a way of warding off any potential regulatory action against it. Is this change big enough to derail Facebook\\'s revenue growth? That\\'s the billion-dollar question, and I don’t think any analyst can estimate the impact as yet.\\nJudging from the Zuckerberg’s comments, however, it’s clear that the move isn’t revenue-neutral. And there will be some negative impact due to lost ad impressions, at least at the beginning. In the long-run, I think, this move is a net positive and doesn’t impact the company’s earning potential. Here\\'s why:\\nFirst, this is a very clever move to keep regulators from dictating what Facebook should do about its content policy. Lowering the risk of a potential government intervention is a smart strategy and beneficial for the business.\\nSecond, Facebook has many options available with which to make up for any revenue loss. One way is to use the popularity of its platform to squeeze more revenue from advertisers by hiking ad rates. Indications are that the company is already moving in this direction.\\nThe number of Facebook ad spots increased 10% in the third quarter from the same period a year ago, while ad prices rose 35%. It was the second consecutive quarter in which the price of ads rose more quickly than the number of ads.\\nThe company can also mitigate the revenue impact by improving growth on its Instagram platform and by monetizing its highly popular WhatsApp application. In a recent announcement, WhatsApp said it would begin allowing business accounts for the first time, a step that lays the groundwork for this free service to start making money for its parent, Facebook.\\nIs The Stock A Buy, Now?\\nTrading at $181.29 at the time of writing, Facebook stock has barely budged this year. For long-term investors, this level offers a great entry point, especially when the company is slated to announce fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, January 31, after the close.\\nDespite all the noise about its newsfeed and declining ad spots, I think Facebook’s ability to generate superior returns for shareholders remains intact. As it has historically done, Facebook will continue to surprise in upcoming quarters, cranking out record profits.\\nInvestors who may be waiting on the sidelines should take advantage of this short-term dip. I see Facebook stock touching the $225 level sooner than many analysts think. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

But the situation on the ground suggests it’ll be a hard combination to show for Uber when it releases its second-quarter earnings tomorrow.\\nThe company is likely to report a $2.1 a share loss on sales of $3.31 billion amid signs rising competition and costs are eroding profitability. Uber, which went public in May, is struggling to satisfy investors in a tough and competitive environment where consumers remain highly price conscious, HSBC analysts Masha Kahn and Henning Cosman wrote in a note last month.\\nThe main rival in North America, Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) often prices 20-25% below Uber in New York while Daimler AG (OTC:DMLRY)-backed Bolt is now doing the same in London, they wrote.\\nUber price chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe uncertain business environment has hurt Uber's stock, which has languished since trading began on May 10. The stock has fallen 16% from the $45 offering price. The shares rose slightly yesterday, after six straight days of losses, gaining 0.3% in New York, to close at $39.15.\\nAfter growing 95% in 2017 from the previous year, the revenue growth from this segment dropped sharply to 33% last year. Uber lost $3.04 billion on an operating basis in 2018 on revenue of $11.3 billion, bringing total operating losses over the past three years to more than $10 billion.\\nUgly Numbers\\nIn the first-quarter earnings released in May, Uber showed a similar trend. Uber’s loss from operations was $1.03 billion, wider than the $478 million reported a year earlier, while its revenue growth continued to shrink. Its revenue from ride-hailing and delivery—minus some incentive payments to drivers and other costs—was $2.62 billion, up 10% from a year ago. By contrast, in the year-earlier quarter, this core revenue on an adjusted basis grew by about 80%.\\nThese numbers are ugly, and that’s why Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi doesn’t want investors to focus on them.\\nInstead, he wants them to value the strength of the company’s evolving “platform,” that he says will one day create the largest modern transportation ecosystem, including its ride-hailing service, its fast-growing food-delivery business, Uber Eats, electric scooters, freight delivery, driverless vehicles and even flying cars.\\nIn his first earnings call in May, he again shared his vision of accelerating growth by integrating Uber with the public transportation, and upselling Uber’s other customers who buy food from Uber Eats or ride its scooters. He said about half of Uber Eats customers don’t use the company’s ride-hailing service.\\nThat all looks great and doable for a tech-driven company that's changed the way people move from to another place. But after the IPO, Uber has to quickly find a way to improve its core business and show investors it’s on the right path to eliminate losses and grow its sales. So far it seems there is a long ride ahead.\\nBottom Line\\nWith competition growing and costs rising, it’s hard to get excited about Uber shares at this point. Investors would be better off waiting on the sidelines and closely watching the company’s performance in 2019 before making a long-term bet. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWith stock markets on track to close the best half year performance in 22 years, events during the coming week could be important enough to set the tone for the second half of the year. Perhaps the most significant: the G20 summit in Japan, which begins this Friday, where President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet and discuss the future of trade between the world’s two largest economies.\\nThe past week's gains suggest that traders have priced in the best possible outcome from these meetings, while ignoring all other potential threats, including geopolitical tension in the Middle East and a slowdown in economic growth. As of last Friday, the S&P 500 was on track to finish its best first half since 1997 with the gains exceeding 17%, after the benchmark was up 19.4% in the first six months.\\nOf course, all this could evaporate quickly if there's bad news from the trade front by the end of next weekend. With all eyes watching the U.S.-China trade talks, the following three stocks will likely also come under investor scrutiny due to their quarterly earnings releases:\\n1. FedEx\\nThe world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), will report Q4 earnings on Tuesday, June 25, after the market close, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and the slowing global economy.\\nFDX Weekly 2016-2019\\nOn average, analysts expect FedEx to report adjusted profits per share of $4.91 on sales of $17.87 billion. According to media reports early this month, FedEx might be at the top of the list of companies China could pick as part of its retaliation for the U.S. crackdown on its Huawei Technologies Inc.\\nThough international trade is the latest negative catalyst pressuring FedEx—with the Chinese retaliatory threat in particular—the company is facing a multitude of other troubles as well. The shipper had been struggling on many fronts even before the latest setback.\\nThe weakness in global demand, especially in Europe where FedEx was betting big after its 2016 acquisition of Netherlands-based parcel delivery company TNT Express, and challenges coming from growing competitive stress between it and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has decided not to renew its domestic U.S. contract with the shipping company, are among the key issues weakening its growth. FedEx shares, which closed at $165.35 on Friday, are trading close to their lowest level in about three years.\\n2. Micron Technology\\nChipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) will report fiscal 2019, third quarter earnings, also on Tuesday, after the close. Analysts are expecting EPS of $0.82 on sales of $4.75 billion.\\nMU Weekly 2016-2019\\nAn array of headwinds have been hitting the company simultaneously, including overall demand weakness across the chip sector; the challenge of dealing with its own inventory build-up; and the U.S.-China trade war.\\nIn March, Micron told investors that revenue in the last period will be about $4.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million. The middle of that range would represent a sales decline of 38%. Micron had projected profit of $0.85 a share, plus or minus $0.10, in the period ending in May.\\nMicron’s latest earnings release and conference call will provide further insight into the sector’s deepening woes and the outlook for the second-half of the year. Micron shares, which traded at $33.25 as of Friday's close, have lost about a quarter of their value in the past three months.\\n3. Nike\\nSportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE:NKE) will report its fiscal 2019, Q4 earnings on Thursday, June 28, after the market closes. Analyst expectations are for EPS of $0.66 on revenue of $10.17 billion.\\nNKE Weekly 2016-2019\\nAfter some weakness in May, Nike shares are rebounding fast on hopes that the U.S. and China will ultimately avoid a full-blown trade confrontation, helping the company to continue its growth in China.\\nThe Asian country is an increasingly important market for Nike. In the quarter ended in February, revenue from greater China rose 24%, the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit gains. The stock—which closed at $85.75 on Friday—is up about 11% since the May 31 low.\\nAnother important number to watch when Nike reports, is the company’s performance in North America, which has been a source of concern for quite some time. Sales in its home market missed analyst expectations in the previous quarter, just as they did in much of 2017 and early 2018. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nA growing stream of dividend income plus full exposure to the internet economy is a combination that's hard to pass up but difficult to come by. Yet right now, that's Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) sweet spot.\\nMSFT Weekly 2015-2018\\nAs a rule, if you’re on the hunt to add a stock to your portfolio that will bring steadily increasing income, look for companies that have the financial stability to continually pay dividends while also supporting an attractive yield. This would mean the company has to run a solid business capable of weathering the inevitable stock market cycles.\\nWhen evaluated by those metrics, software and hardware giant Microsoft ticks all the boxes. Here's why we think Microsoft is one of the premier technology stocks for income investors.\\nGrowth Momentum\\nDespite many considering Microsoft to be simply a legacy tech company that built its business around its Office software and Windows operating system, the company’s wide economic moat remains intact. And it's the companies that are able to successfully defend their turf from competition that are also the ones able to deliver uninterrupted dividends.\\nMicrosoft remains the leader in the desktop and laptop operating system market with a commanding 88% market share. Office, which has been transformed into a subscription service for companies that use it, continues to be a powerful driver of earnings. In the last fiscal year, these two units drove 52% of Microsoft's total sales.\\nTo its credit, even as Microsoft remains successful at protecting Windows and Office—its cash cows—the company has also succeeded at grabbing a major share of additional, new-growth areas within the internet economy. Microsoft’s server and cloud computing division generated $20 billion a year in sales. Only Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) beats them in market share within this segment. As well, MIcrosoft's foray into social media with the acquisition of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) in 2016, has delivered revenue grow of 37% in the most recent quarter.\\nLast month, in another strategic move, Microsoft acquired GitHub, a web based hosting service, for $7.5 billion. This gives them access to the army of developers who use GitHub’s code repository products on a daily basis. GitHub hosts 27 million software developers working on 80 million repositories of computer code.\\nMicrosoft's earnings momentum remains impressive. In the latest quarter, revenue rose 16% to $26.8 billion, operating income jumped by 23%, and earnings per share vaulted higher by 36% to $0.95 a share, making it the best quarter for Microsoft in many years, confirming that CEO Satya Nadella’s turnaround strategy is working.\\nSustainable Dividend\\nBeyond the company’s business strength, the other important factor that makes a stock a good candidate for an income portfolio is the company’s ability to sustain its dividend payouts. You don’t want to buy a stock that offers a juicy dividend yield, just to be hit by a payout cut down the road. Rather, you want to invest in a business that generates recurring cash flow quarter-after-quarter to support—and perhaps even grow—its payout.\\nMicrosoft has an excellent track record on this score. Since 2004, when it first began paying a dividend, the company’s payout has swelled by 425%. Dividend growth has been supported by a low payout ratio and strong underlying businesses.\\nWith an annual dividend yield of 1.7%, Microsoft pays a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. That yield may look meager to many investors, but don’t forget that Microsoft stock has had an excellent run during the past 12 months, gaining 45% and outperforming many big tech names, including Google (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\\nBottom Line\\nMicrosoft is focusing on the areas of technology where it is relevant but where it also has opportunities to lead in the future. That includes cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and corporate software.The cloud computing market, for example, is expected to grow from $285 billion last year to $411 billion by 2020. That segment alone is big enough to drive the company’s revenue growth for the next three to four years, according to Microsoft executives.\\nIf you're looking for long-term income via a solid dividend stock, we see Microsoft shares as a good fit for this approach to investing.The stock offers upside potential with income growth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"]"

       "\"\\nIt’s going to be another tough week for global stocks amid signs that both the U.S. and China are set to escalate their trade war even further, even as President Trump expands the use of his tariff weapon to other countries.\\nBloomberg reported on Friday that China has already formulated a plan to restrict exports of rare earths to the U.S. if it needs to. On another front, President Trump said he plans to impose a 5% U.S. tariff on all Mexican goods because of illegal immigration. Trump on Friday also terminated a preferential treatment to India’s exports of nearly 2,000 products to the U.S. duty-free.\\nThese negative developments are likely to pressure equities further. The S&P 500 just finished its worst May performance in seven years. While investors will focus on these macro issues, below are three stocks which might see price action triggered by company-specific developments.\\n1. Salesforce.com\\nSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which sells software and cloud-based services to corporate clients, will report first-quarter 2019 earnings on Tuesday, June 4, after the market close. On average, analysts expect $0.61 a share profit on sales of $3.56 billion.\\nCRM Weekly TTM\\nSalesforce’s share price chart during the past six months tells a similar story story to that of the overall market which is under pressure due to the U.S.-China trade war and the associated uncertainty that could hurt global technology spending. Trading at $151.41 per share as of Friday's close, the stock has already shed more than half of the gains it posted since the start of the year.\\nBut beyond these macro headwinds, San Francisco-based Salesforce’s business seems to be maturing and with this development the days of large spending on cloud-computing appear to be behind us, at least in the current cycle. In March, the company provided a revenue forecast that fell short of estimates. Sales were forecast to be $3.67-$3.68 billion in the period ending in April. The projected revenue increase of 22% for Q1 would be the smallest year-over-year gain since at least 2010.\\n2. CVS Health\\nAfter boosting its profit outlook at the beginning of May, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) will hold an investor day on Tuesday.\\nCVS Weekly TTM\\nA healthy profit outlook for 2019 and a strong Q1 earnings report, however, have so far failed to boost investor confidence in the stock which is down more than 20% this year. It closed on Friday at $52.37 amid worries over the changing U.S. drug landscape and strong competition from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).\\nCVS management should help “alleviate the uncertainty weighing on shares,” Morgan Stanley) analyst Ricky Goldwasser wrote in a note to clients in April. Concerns persist regarding the integration costs of its $69-billion merger with Aetna (NYSE:AET), which closed in late November, making the merged entity one of the largest health care insurance and benefits companies in the industry.\\nThe merger is a way for CVS to beef up its brick-and-mortar operations while boosting the services side of the business. It's a response to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) efforts at taking on the healthcare industry.\\n3. Beyond Meat\\nThe plant-based meat substitute producer, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) will release Q1 earnings on Thursday, June 6 after the market close. It's the company's first report since going public in early May.\\nBYND 300 Minute Chart\\nThe stock, which closed at $104.12 on Friday, has been the darling of investors since its IPO on Thursday May 2. Though the IPO was priced at $25 a share, it started trading at $46. Beyond Meat's shares have surged more than four-fold on expectations that the company's vegetable-based products have huge market potential.\\nIndeed, the company is targeting consumers who are seeking a meat substitute that looks and tastes good. Beyond Meat’s biggest attraction is that its products come surprisingly close to real meat in taste, smell, texture and appearance.\\nLuckily for Beyond Meat, the $878 million-a-year-and-growing market for meat substitutes was left open by big food players, giving startups like Beyond Meat and privately-held Impossible Foods Inc. an opportunity to fill the gap. To capture the broader market possibilities, Beyond Meat has developed three plant-based products that align with the largest meat categories globally: beef, pork and poultry.\\nOn the back of such a powerful—and unexpected—rally, the stock is highly vulnerable to any slight miss on earnings. For Q1, analysts are expecting a loss of $0.16 a share with sales growing to $31.5 million. \\n\\n\\n\\n\""
